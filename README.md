Welcome to the REST API reference for the Zuora Billing, Payments, and Central Platform!

To learn about the common use cases of Zuora REST APIs, check out the [REST API Tutorials](https://developer.zuora.com/rest-api/api-guides/overview/).

In addition to Zuora API Reference, we also provide API references for other Zuora products:

  * [Revenue API Reference](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/revenue/overview/)
  * [Collections API Reference](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/collections/overview/)


    
The Zuora REST API provides a broad set of operations and resources that:

  * Enable Web Storefront integration from your website.
  * Support self-service subscriber sign-ups and account management.
  * Process revenue schedules through custom revenue rule models.
  * Enable manipulation of most objects in the Zuora Billing Object Model.

Some of our older APIs are no longer recommended but still available, not affecting any existing integration. To find related API documentation, see [Older API Reference](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/older-api/overview/).


## Access to the API<a id="access-to-the-api"></a>

If you have a Zuora tenant, you can access the Zuora REST API via one of the following endpoints:

| Tenant              | Base URL for REST Endpoints |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|US Cloud 1 Production | https://rest.na.zuora.com  |
|US Cloud 1 API Sandbox |  https://rest.sandbox.na.zuora.com |
|US Cloud 2 Production | https://rest.zuora.com |
|US Cloud 2 API Sandbox | https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com|
|US Central Sandbox | https://rest.test.zuora.com |  
|US Performance Test | https://rest.pt1.zuora.com |
|US Production Copy | Submit a request at <a href=\"http://support.zuora.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> to enable the Zuora REST API in your tenant and obtain the base URL for REST endpoints. See [REST endpoint base URL of Production Copy (Service) Environment for existing and new customers](https://community.zuora.com/t5/API/REST-endpoint-base-URL-of-Production-Copy-Service-Environment/td-p/29611) for more information. |
|EU Production | https://rest.eu.zuora.com |
|EU API Sandbox | https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com |
|EU Central Sandbox | https://rest.test.eu.zuora.com |

The Production endpoint provides access to your live user data. Sandbox tenants are a good place to test code without affecting real-world data. If you would like Zuora to provision a Sandbox tenant for you, contact your Zuora representative for assistance.


If you do not have a Zuora tenant, go to <a href=\"https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data, including a sample product catalog.


# Error Handling<a id="error-handling"></a>

If a request to Zuora Billing REST API with an endpoint starting with `/v1` (except [Actions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/tag/Actions) and CRUD operations) fails, the response will contain an eight-digit error code with a corresponding error message to indicate the details of the error.

The following code snippet is a sample error response that contains an error code and message pair:

```
 {
   \"success\": false,
   \"processId\": \"CBCFED6580B4E076\",
   \"reasons\":  [
     {
      \"code\": 53100320,
      \"message\": \"'termType' value should be one of: TERMED, EVERGREEN\"
     }
    ]
 }
```
The `success` field indicates whether the API request has succeeded. The `processId` field is a Zuora internal ID that you can provide to Zuora Global Support for troubleshooting purposes.

The `reasons` field contains the actual error code and message pair. The error code begins with `5` or `6` means that you encountered a certain issue that is specific to a REST API resource in Zuora Billing, Payments, and Central Platform. For example, `53100320` indicates that an invalid value is specified for the `termType` field of the `subscription` object.

The error code beginning with `9` usually indicates that an authentication-related issue occurred, and it can also indicate other unexpected errors depending on different cases. For example, `90000011` indicates that an invalid credential is provided in the request header. 

When troubleshooting the error, you can divide the error code into two components: REST API resource code and error category code. See the following Zuora error code sample:

<a href=\"https://developer.zuora.com/images/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://developer.zuora.com/images/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg\" alt=\"Zuora Error Code Sample\"></a>


**Note:** Zuora determines resource codes based on the request payload. Therefore, if GET and DELETE requests that do not contain payloads fail, you will get `500000` as the resource code, which indicates an unknown object and an unknown field. 
The error category code of these requests is valid and follows the rules described in the [Error Category Codes](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/Error-Handling/Error-Category-Codes) section. 
In such case, you can refer to the returned error message to troubleshoot.


## REST API Resource Codes<a id="rest-api-resource-codes"></a>

The 6-digit resource code indicates the REST API resource, typically a field of a Zuora object, on which the issue occurs. In the preceding example, `531003` refers to the `termType` field of the `subscription` object. 

The value range for all REST API resource codes is from `500000` to `679999`. See <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/AA_REST_API/Resource_Codes\" target=\"_blank\">Resource Codes</a> in the Knowledge Center for a full list of resource codes.

## Error Category Codes<a id="error-category-codes"></a>

The 2-digit error category code identifies the type of error, for example, resource not found or missing required field. 

The following table describes all error categories and the corresponding resolution:

| Code    | Error category              | Description    | Resolution    |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| 10      | Permission or access denied | The request cannot be processed because a certain tenant or user permission is missing. | Check the missing tenant or user permission in the response message and contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> for enablement. |
| 11      | Authentication failed       | Authentication fails due to invalid API authentication credentials. | Ensure that a valid API credential is specified. |
| 20      | Invalid format or value     | The request cannot be processed due to an invalid field format or value. | Check the invalid field in the error message, and ensure that the format and value of all fields you passed in are valid. |
| 21      | Unknown field in request    | The request cannot be processed because an unknown field exists in the request body. | Check the unknown field name in the response message, and ensure that you do not include any unknown field in the request body. |
| 22      | Missing required field      | The request cannot be processed because a required field in the request body is missing. | Check the missing field name in the response message, and ensure that you include all required fields in the request body. |
| 23      | Missing required parameter  | The request cannot be processed because a required query parameter is missing. | Check the missing parameter name in the response message, and ensure that you include the parameter in the query. |
| 30      | Rule restriction            | The request cannot be processed due to the violation of a Zuora business rule. | Check the response message and ensure that the API request meets the specified business rules. |
| 40      | Not found                   | The specified resource cannot be found. | Check the response message and ensure that the specified resource exists in your Zuora tenant. |
| 45      | Unsupported request         | The requested endpoint does not support the specified HTTP method. | Check your request and ensure that the endpoint and method matches. |
| 50      | Locking contention          | This request cannot be processed because the objects this request is trying to modify are being modified by another API request, UI operation, or batch job process. | <p>Resubmit the request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs, contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance.</p> |
| 60      | Internal error              | The server encounters an internal error. | Contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance. |
| 61      | Temporary error             | A temporary error occurs during request processing, for example, a database communication error. | <p>Resubmit the request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs, contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance. </p>|
| 70      | Request exceeded limit      | The total number of concurrent requests exceeds the limit allowed by the system. | <p>Resubmit the request after the number of seconds specified by the `Retry-After` value in the response header.</p> <p>Check [Concurrent request limits](https://developer.zuora.com/rest-api/general-concepts/rate-concurrency-limits/) for details about Zuora’s concurrent request limit policy.</p> |
| 90      | Malformed request           | The request cannot be processed due to JSON syntax errors. | Check the syntax error in the JSON request body and ensure that the request is in the correct JSON format. |
| 99      | Integration error           | The server encounters an error when communicating with an external system, for example, payment gateway, tax engine provider. | Check the response message and take action accordingly. |


# API Versions<a id="api-versions"></a>

The Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the API. 

## Major Version <a id="major-version-"></a>

The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. In this API reference, only the **v1** major version is available. For example, `POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`. 

 

 Zuora also offers the [Quickstart API](https://developer.zuora.com/quickstart-api/quickstart-api-introduction/) that uses the **v2** major version. For more information about which version to use, see [Which API Should I Use](https://developer.zuora.com/api-reference-guide/). 

## Minor Version<a id="minor-version"></a>


Zuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to replace it. 


Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request header to process without an error. 

If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions. For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.

If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we note that in the field description.

You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the  `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.

For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration. 

### Minor Version History<a id="minor-version-history"></a>

The supported minor versions are not consecutive. 
You can use the following versions to override the default version (`186.0`):
  - 187.0
  - 188.0
  - 189.0
  - 196.0
  - 206.0
  - 207.0
  - 211.0
  - 214.0
  - 215.0
  - 216.0
  - 223.0
  - 224.0
  - 230.0
  - 239.0
  - 256.0
  - 257.0
  - 309.0
  - 314.0
  - 315.0
  - 329.0
  - 330.0
  - 336.0
  - 337.0
  - 338.0
  - 341.0

If you set the `zuora-version` header to a version excluded from the preceding list, the corresponding API request is processed as you use the default version, `186.0`.

The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a Zuora REST API minor version.

# API Names for Zuora Objects<a id="api-names-for-zuora-objects"></a>

For information about the Zuora business object model, see [Zuora Business Object Model](https://developer.zuora.com/rest-api/general-concepts/object-model/).

You can use the [Describe](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/GET_Describe) operation to list the fields of each Zuora object that is available in your tenant. When you call the operation, you must specify the API name of the Zuora object.

The following table provides the API name of each Zuora object:

## Reference<a id="reference"></a>
### `zuora.api_health.system_health_api_volume_summary`<a id="zuoraapi_healthsystem_health_api_volume_summary"></a>

Returns volume summary of [API](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API) usage that generated by your Zuora tenant within a specified time range.

You can filter the summary by API path name and http method.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
system_health_api_volume_summary_response = zuora.api_health.system_health_api_volume_summary(
    authorization="Authorization_example",
    start_time="1970-01-01T00:00:00.00Z",
    end_time="1970-01-01T00:00:00.00Z",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    path="string_example",
    http_method="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### start_time: `datetime`<a id="start_time-datetime"></a>

Start time of the volume summary.  Format: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mmZ` Example: `2022-09-22T09:07+0800`. 

##### end_time: `datetime`<a id="end_time-datetime"></a>

End time of the volume summary.  Format: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mmZ` Example: `2022-09-29T09:07+0800`. 

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### path: `str`<a id="path-str"></a>

Filters the volume summary by API path name.  You can refer to the api listed in the [API System Health Dashboard](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Zuora_System_Health/B_APIs_dashboard) for the path name. Example: `/v1/accounts/{account-key}`. 

##### http_method: `str`<a id="http_method-str"></a>

Filters the volume summary by http method. Example: `POST`. 

#### 🔄 Return<a id="🔄-return"></a>

### `zuora.accounting_codes.accounting_code`<a id="zuoraaccounting_codesaccounting_code"></a>

This reference describes how to create a new accounting code through the REST API. 
The accounting code will be active as soon as it has been created.

### Prerequisites<a id="prerequisites"></a>
  If you have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant, you must have the  Configure Accounting Codes permission. 


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
accounting_code_response = zuora.accounting_codes.accounting_code(
    body=None,
    gl_account_name="string_example",
    gl_account_number="string_example",
    name="string_example",
    notes="string_example",
    type="AccountsReceivable",
    idempotency_key="string_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### gl_account_name: `str`<a id="gl_account_name-str"></a>

Name of the account in your general ledger.  Field only available if you have Zuora Finance enabled. Maximum of 255 characters. 

##### gl_account_number: `str`<a id="gl_account_number-str"></a>

Account number in your general ledger.  Field only available if you have Zuora Finance enabled. Maximum of 255 characters. 

##### name: `str`<a id="name-str"></a>

Name of the accounting code.  Accounting code name must be unique. Maximum of 100 characters. 

##### notes: `str`<a id="notes-str"></a>

Maximum of 2,000 characters. 

##### type: `str`<a id="type-str"></a>

If you want to create multiple accounting codes of the type `AccountsReceivable`, you need to have [Invoice Item Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/C_Invoice_Item_Settlement) enabled and contact [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com) to access the Multiple AR Accounting Codes feature.   Note that `On-Account Receivable` is only available if you enable the Invoice Settlement feature.  

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.

This reference describes how to activate an accounting code through the REST API.

Prerequisites
-------------
If you have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant, you must have the Manage Accounting Code permission. 


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
activate_accounting_code_response = zuora.accounting_codes.activate_accounting_code(
    ac_id="ac-id_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### ac_id: `str`<a id="ac_id-str"></a>

ID of the accounting code you want to activate.

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### page: `int`<a id="page-int"></a>

The index number of the page that you want to retrieve. This parameter is dependent on `pageSize`. You must set `pageSize` before specifying `page`. For example, if you set `pageSize` to `20` and `page` to `2`, the 21st to 40th records are returned in the response.

### `zuora.accounting_periods.close_accounting_period`<a id="zuoraaccounting_periodsclose_accounting_period"></a>

Close an accounting period by accounting period ID.

Prerequisites
-------------
You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant. You must have the Manage Close Process and Run Trial Balance user permissions.

Limitations
-----------
* The accounting period cannot already be closed.
* The accounting period cannot be in the process of running a trial balance.
* All earlier accounting periods must be closed.
* There must be no required action items for the accounting period. See Reconcile Transactions Before Closing an Accounting Period for more information.

Notes
-----
When you close an accounting period in Zuora, a trial balance is automatically run for that period. A successful response means only that the accounting period is now closed, but does not mean that the trial balance has successfully completed.

#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
close_accounting_period_response = zuora.accounting_periods.close_accounting_period(
    ap_id="ap-id_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### ap_id: `str`<a id="ap_id-str"></a>

ID of the accounting period you want to close.

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.accounting_periods.pending_close_accounting_period`<a id="zuoraaccounting_periodspending_close_accounting_period"></a>

Sets an accounting period to pending close.


Prerequisites
-------------

* You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant.
* You must have the Manage Close Process and Run Trial Balance user permissions.

            
Limitations 
 -----------
 
 * The accounting period cannot be closed or pending close.
 
 * The accounting period cannot be in the process of running a trial balance.
 
 * All earlier accounting periods must be closed.


 


 
Notes
-----
When you set an accounting period to pending close in Zuora, a trial balance is automatically run for that period. A response of `{ "success": true }`  means only that the accounting period status is now pending close, but does not mean that the trial balance has successfully completed. You can use the Get Accounting Period REST API call to view details about the outcome of the trial balance.

### `zuora.accounts.account`<a id="zuoraaccountsaccount"></a>

Creates a customer account with a payment method, a bill-to contact, and an optional sold-to contact. Request and response field descriptions and sample code are provided. Use this operation to optionally create a subscription, invoice for that subscription, and collect payment through the default payment method. The transaction is atomic; if any part fails for any reason, the entire transaction is rolled back.

This operation is CORS Enabled, so you can use client-side Javascript to invoke the call. 

### Notes<a id="notes"></a>
1. The account is created in active status.  
2. If the `autoPay` field is set to `true` in the request, you must provide one of the `paymentMethod`, `creditCard`, or `hpmCreditCardPaymentMethodId` field, but not multiple. The one provided becomes the default payment method for this account. If the credit card information is declined or cannot be verified, no account is created.
3. Customer accounts created with this call are automatically be set to Auto Pay.
4. If the `invoiceDeliveryPrefsEmail` field is not specified in the request, the account's email delivery preference is always automatically set to  `false`, no matter whether the  `workEmail`  or  `personalEmail`  field is specified.

### Defaults for customerAcceptanceDate and serviceActivationDate<a id="defaults-for-customeracceptancedate-and-serviceactivationdate"></a>
Default values for **customerAcceptanceDate** and **serviceActivationDate** are set as follows.

### `zuora.accounts.account_1`<a id="zuoraaccountsaccount_1"></a>

Updates a customer account by specifying the account-key.

### Notes<a id="notes"></a>
1. Only the fields to be changed should be specified.  Any field that is not included in the request body will not be changed.
2. If an empty field is submitted with this operation, the corresponding field in the account is emptied.
3. Email addresses: If no email addresses are specified, no change is made to the email addresses or to the email delivery preference. If either the **personalEmail** or **workEmail** of **billToContact** is specified (or both), the system updates the corresponding email address(es) and the email delivery preference is set to `true`. (In that case, emails go to the **workEmail** address, if it exists, or else the **personalEmail**.) On the other hand, if as a result of this call both of the email addresses for the account are empty, the email delivery preference is set to `false`.
4. The bill-to and sold-to contacts are separate data entities. If you select the **Same as Bill To Contact** check box during account creation, both the Bill To and Sold To contacts are updated upon updating either one because they point to the same contact record. In this case, if you want to update only one of them, you have to first create another contact and update the Bill To or Sold To contact of the customer account to be the newly created one.

### `zuora.accounts.account_2`<a id="zuoraaccountsaccount_2"></a>

Deletes a specific account asynchronously. 

**Notes and Limitations:** 
- For account deletion, the system will start a backend job to remove all transactions under the accounts and change the status of the accounts to 'Cancelled'. This backend job is asynchronous and will take some time, depending on the job size.  
- An account cannot be deleted when the account is either the invoice owner or the subscription owner of a subscription and the subscription's invoice owner and subscription owner are two different accounts. An exception to this limitation is if the <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Billing_and_Invoicing/Billing_Settings/Define_Default_Subscription_and_Order_Settings#Enable_Force_Deletion_for_Account.3F" target="_blank">Enable Force Deletion for Account?</a> setting is set to `Yes`, you can force delete an account that is the subscription owner of a subscription while the invoice owner is a different account. Force deleting this account deletes all its subscriptions, but the relevant invoices will not be impacted.
- An account cannot be deleted if this account has ever been involved in an Owner Transfer amendment or order action, either as the current owner or as the previous owner.

### `zuora.actions.p_os_tcreate`<a id="zuoraactionsp_os_tcreate"></a>

Use the create call to create one or more objects of a specific type. You can specify different types in different create calls, but each create call must apply to only one type of object.

### Limitations <a id="limitations-"></a>

This call has the following limitations:

* A maximum of 50 objects are supported in a single call.
* The Orders feature is not supported.
* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.
* The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To create objects according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).


### How to use this call<a id="how-to-use-this-call"></a>

You can create on an array of one or more zObjects. The fields you should specify can be found in the corresponding "CRUD: Create an *zObject*" operation.
For example, to create one or multiple accounts, use the request fields in the [CRUD: Create an account](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/older-api/operation/Object_POSTAccount/) operation.

It returns an array of SaveResults sorted in the same order, indicating the success or failure of creating each object. The following information applies to this call:

* You cannot pass in null zObjects.
* You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.
* All objects must be of the same type.

#### Using Create and Subscribe Calls <a id="using-create-and-subscribe-calls-"></a>

Both the Create and Subscribe calls will create a new account. However, there are differences between the calls.

Use the create call to create an account independent of a subscription.

Use the subscribe call to create the account with the subscription and the initial payment information.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
p_os_tcreate_response = zuora.actions.p_os_tcreate(
    objects=[
        {
            "key": None,
        }
    ],
    type="InvoiceItemAdjustment",
    idempotency_key="string_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.

### `zuora.actions.p_os_tquery`<a id="zuoraactionsp_os_tquery"></a>

The query call sends a query expression by specifying the object to query, the fields to retrieve from that object, and any filters to determine whether a given object should be queried.

You can use [Zuora Object Query Language](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/K_Zuora_Object_Query_Language)(ZOQL) to construct those queries, passing them through the `queryString`.

Once the call is made, the API executes the query against the specified object and returns a query response object to your application. Your application can then iterate through rows in the query response to retrieve information.

### Limitations<a id="limitations"></a>

This call has the following limitations:

* All [ZOQL limitations](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/Query/ZOQL#ZOQL_Limitations) apply.
* All ZOQL keywords must be in lower case.
* The number of records returned is limited to 2000 records.
* The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.
* The Orders feature is not supported, which means that the objects listed in [Orders Object Model](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/BA_Orders_Object_Model) are not supported.
* The Active Rating feature is not supported.
* The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To query objects or fields according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).
* Fields with NULL values are not returned in the response.

### `zuora.actions.p_os_tquery_more`<a id="zuoraactionsp_os_tquery_more"></a>

Use queryMore to request additional results from a previous query call. If your initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use queryMore to query for the additional results.


Any `queryLocator` results greater than 2,000, will only be stored by Zuora for 5 days before it is deleted.


 This call sends a request for additional results from an initial query call. If the initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use the `queryLocator` returned from query to request the next set of results.


**Note:** Zuora expires queryMore cursors after 15 minutes of activity.


To use queryMore, you first construct a query call. By default, the query call will return up to 2000 results. If there are more than 2000 results, query will return a boolean `done`, which will be marked as `false`, and a `queryLocator`, which is a marker you will pass to queryMore to get the next set of results.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
p_os_tquery_more_response = zuora.actions.p_os_tquery_more(

To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).


### How to use this call? <a id="how-to-use-this-call-"></a>

You can update an array of one or more zObjects. The fields you should specify can be found in the corresponding "CRUD: Update an *zObject*" operation.
For example, to update one or multiple accounts, use the request fields in the [CRUD: Update an account](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/older-api/operation/Object_PUTAccount/) operation.

It returns an array of SaveResults sorted in the same order, indicating the success or failure of updating each object. The following information applies to this call:

* You cannot pass in null zObjects.
* You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.
* All objects must be of the same type.
* For each field in each object, you must determine that object's ID. Then populate the fields that you want update with the new information.
* Zuora ignores unrecognized fields in update calls. For example, if an optional field is spelled incorrectly or a field that does not exist is specified, Zuora ignores the field and continues to process the call. No error message is returned for unrecognized fields.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
p_os_tupdate_response = zuora.actions.p_os_tupdate(
    objects=[
        None
    ],
    type="Account",
    idempotency_key="string_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    reject_unknown_fields=False,
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    x_zuora_wsdl_version="79",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### objects: List[`ZObjectUpdate`]<a id="objects-listzobjectupdate"></a>

##### type: `str`<a id="type-str"></a>

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### reject_unknown_fields: `bool`<a id="reject_unknown_fields-bool"></a>

Specifies whether the call fails if the request body contains unknown fields. With `rejectUnknownFields` set to `true`, Zuora returns a 400 response if the request body contains unknown fields. The body of the 400 response is:  ```json {     \"message\": \"Error - unrecognised fields\" } ```  By default, Zuora ignores unknown fields in the request body. 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### x_zuora_wsdl_version: `str`<a id="x_zuora_wsdl_version-str"></a>

Zuora WSDL version number.

    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### version: `Union[int, float]`<a id="version-unionint-float"></a>

The API version you want to use.   The supported versions are as follows:   - `1.1`. It supports both modes   - `1.0`. Default. It supports stateless modes only.  See <a href=\\\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/API/AB_Aggregate_Query_API/BA_Stateless_and_Stateful_Modes\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Stateless and stateful modes</a> for more information. 

##### date_time_utc: `bool`<a id="date_time_utc-bool"></a>

When using WSDL 69 and later you can ensure that the exported output of dateTime records are rendered according to ISO-8601 generic UTC form by setting `dateTimeUtc` to `true`.  When `dateTimeUtc` is set to `true`, exports of dateTime data types will be rendered in the following generic format: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss-hhmm` or `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hhmm`.  **Note**: Regardless of what batchType query is used (`zoql` or `zoqlexport`), the query response output for datetime data types can be standardized by setting dateTimeUtc to `true`. When `true`, the results will display datetime types with the format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+/-hhmm. 

##### format: `str`<a id="format-str"></a>

The format of the query. The default value is `csv`. 

##### incremental_time: `str`<a id="incremental_time-str"></a>

Allows you to override the time from which a Stateful AQuA job incrementally retrieves records that have been created or modified, using the `incrementalTime` parameter. For example, if you set `incrementalTime` = `2015-01-21 10:30:01`, AQuA will retrieve records that have created or modified beginning at 10:30:01. If this parameter is not set, AQuA continues to use the Start Time of the last AQuA session to retrieve records incrementally.  The time zone of `incrementalTime` depends on which Zuora data center you use. For US Data Center customers, the time zone of `incrementalTime` is Pacific Time. For EU Data Center customers, the time zone of `incrementalTime` is UTC. If the time zone of your system is different from the time zone of `incrementalTime`, you will need to convert to the appropriate time zone before setting `incrementalTime`.  **Note**: This field can only be used in Stateful AQuA mode. 

##### name: `str`<a id="name-str"></a>

The name of the job. 32 character limit. 

##### notify_url: `str`<a id="notify_url-str"></a>

If URL is provided, the AQuA job will call this `notifyUrl` once the job has completed. The value of `notifyUrl` needs to have `${JOBID}` and `${STATUS}` placeholders. These placeholders will be replaced by the actual job ID and status when returned in the response. Status will be `Completed` after the AQuA job is done.  If you submit an AQuA query with `notifyUrl` specified, the value of `notifyUrl` will be ignored if your organization has already <a href=\\\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/API/AB_Aggregate_Query_API/Callout_Notification_for_Completed_AQuA_Jobs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">configured a callout notification through the Zuora user interface</a>.  

##### null_replacement: `str`<a id="null_replacement-str"></a>

The string used to represent null values in the query results. If you do not set this parameter, null values are represented by the empty string in the query results. 

##### offset: `Union[int, float]`<a id="offset-unionint-float"></a>

This field specifies the time offset for AQuA queries in stateful mode. It is an integer in the range 0 to 3,600 seconds.  For example, if you set this field to 600 seconds and you post a query in stateful mode at 2:00 AM, it will query against data created or updated between the completion time of the previous query and 1:50 AM.  The value of this field will override the value you configured in **Settings** > **Administration** > **AQuA API Stateful Mode Time Offset**.         

##### partner: `str`<a id="partner-str"></a>

The partner field indicates the unique ID of a data integration partner. The dropdown list of this field displays partner IDs for the past thirty days. It must be used together with \\\"project\\\" field to uniquely identify a data integration target.  For example, if a continuous AQuA session is to retrieve data incrementally for a Salesforce.com Org 00170000011K3Ub, you can use partner as \\\"Salesforce\\\", and \\\"project\\\" as \\\"00170000011K3Ub.\\\"  This field is required only if you are using AQuA in stateful mode. Otherwise, if you are using AQuA in stateless mode, partner field can be null.  **Note**: Zuora highly recommends you use the stateless mode instead of the stateful mode to extract bulk data. See <a href=\\\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/API/AB_Aggregate_Query_API/Bulk_data__extraction_from_Zuora_using_AQuA\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Bulk data extraction from Zuora using AQuA</a> for best practices. **Note**: Submit a request at <a href=\\\"http://support.zuora.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Zuora Global Support</a> to obtain a partner ID. 

##### project: `str`<a id="project-str"></a>

The project field contains the unique ID of a data integration project for a particular partner. The dropdown list of this field displays project IDs for the past thirty days.  This field must be used together with partner field to uniquely identify a data integration target.   This field is required only if you are using AQuA in stateful mode. Otherwise, if you are using AQuA in stateless mode, partner field can be null. 

##### queries: List[`BatchQuery`]<a id="queries-listbatchquery"></a>

A JSON array object that contains a list of batch objects. 

##### source_data: `str`<a id="source_data-str"></a>

Specify the source this aggregate query runs against:  * `LIVE` represents the live transactional databases at Zuora (Data Query Live).  * `WAREHOUSE` represents Zuora Warehouse, which has better performance and fewer limitations than the live transactional database. This option is available only if you have the Zuora Warehouse feature enabled in your tenant. For more information, see <a href=\\\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Zuora_Warehouse/A_Zuora_Warehouse_overview\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Zuora Warehouse</a>. <br>If this option is selected, you can specify warehouse size in `warehouseSize`.  If this field is not specified, the default value `LIVE` will be used. 

##### use_query_labels: `bool`<a id="use_query_labels-bool"></a>

When this optional flag is set to `true` the request will use object and field API names for the CSV header output instead of the field labels. Data integration projects should set `useQueryLabels` to `true` so that API names remain the same.  By default `useQueryLabels` is `false`, so that output CSV headers display the more user-friendly object and field labels.  

##### warehouse_size: `str`<a id="warehouse_size-str"></a>

Specify the size of Zuora Warehouse. This field is available only if the `sourceData` is `WAREHOUSE`.  If this field is not specified or set to `NULL`, the default value `xsmall` will be used. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.

#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
attachments_response = zuora.attachments.attachments(
    associated_object_type="Account",
    associated_object_key="associatedObjectKey_example",
    file=open('/path/to/file', 'rb'),
    idempotency_key="string_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    description="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### associated_object_type: `str`<a id="associated_object_type-str"></a>

The type of the object to add attachements for.  

##### associated_object_key: `str`<a id="associated_object_key-str"></a>

For the Subscription type, specify the Subscription Number. An attachment is tied to the Subscription Number and thus viewable with every subscription version.  For Account, Credit Memo, and Debit Memo, specify the corresponding ID or number. For Invoice, specify the corresponding ID. 

##### file: `IO`<a id="file-io"></a>

The file to be attached. Files with the following extensions are supported: .pdf, .csv, .png, .xlsx, .xls, .doc, .docx, .msg, .jpg, .txt, .htm, .html, .eml, .pptx, .gif, .rtf, .xml, .jpeg, .log, .cls  The maximum file size is 4 MB. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### description: `str`<a id="description-str"></a>

Description of the attachment document.

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### bill_run_id: `str`<a id="bill_run_id-str"></a>

The unique ID of a bill run. 

##### cancel_once: `bool`<a id="cancel_once-bool"></a>

Whether to cancel the current bill run or cancel all future recurring bill runs, only valid for a scheduled bill run. 

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

End time of the volume summary.  Format: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mmZ` Example: `2022-09-22T09:07+0800`. 

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.

If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).

### `zuora.billing_preview_run.billing_preview_run`<a id="zuorabilling_preview_runbilling_preview_run"></a>

Creates a billing preview run for multiple customer accounts.

The maximum supported preview duration is 20 years, calculated from the current date to the target date.

You can run up to 20 billing preview runs in batches concurrently. A single batch of customer accounts can only have one billing preview run at a time. So you can have up to 20 batches running at the same time. If you create a billing preview run for all customer batches, you cannot create another billing preview run until this preview run is completed.

Note that the preview results for each billing preview run will be stored in the system for 180 days; after that they will be purged.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
billing_preview_run_response = zuora.billing_preview_run.billing_preview_run(
    target_date="Mon Jan 09 16:00:00 PST 2017",
    assume_renewal="None",
    batch="string_example",
    batches="Batch1, Batch2",
    charge_type_to_exclude="",
    including_draft_items=False,
    including_evergreen_subscription=True,
    organization_labels=[
        {
        }
    ],
    storage_option="Csv",
    idempotency_key="string_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_version="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### target_date: `date`<a id="target_date-date"></a>

The target date for the billing preview run. The billing preview run generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the target date.   The value for the `targetDate` field must be in _`YYYY-MM-DD`_ format.  If the target date is later than the subscription current term end date, the preview invoice item data and credit memo item data is generated from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the current term end date. If you want to generate preview invoice item data and credit memo item data past the end of the subscription current term, specify the AssumeRenewal field in the request.  **Note:** The credit memo item data is only available if you have Invoice Settlement feature enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. 

##### assume_renewal: `str`<a id="assume_renewal-str"></a>

Indicates whether to generate a preview of future invoice items and credit memo items with the assumption that the subscriptions are renewed.  Set one of the following values in this field to decide how the assumption is applied in the billing preview.    * **All:** The assumption is applied to all the subscriptions. Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the target date.      * **None:** (Default) The assumption is not applied to the subscriptions. Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data based on the current term end date and the target date.        * If the target date is later than the current term end date, Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the current term end date.      * If the target date is earlier than the current term end date, Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memeo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the target date.    * **Autorenew:** The assumption is applied to the subscriptions that have auto-renew enabled. Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the target date.      **Note:**    - This field can only be used if the subscription renewal term is not set to 0.           - The credit memo item data is only available if you have Invoice Settlement feature enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.  

##### batch: `str`<a id="batch-str"></a>

The customer batch to include in the billing preview run. If not specified, all customer batches are included.   **Note**:    - **Note**: By default, you have 50 configurable account batches. To increase the limit to 200 batches, you must have the <a href=\\\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Performance_Booster_Elite\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Performance Booster Elite</a> package.   - This field is not available if you set the `zuora-version` request header to `314.0` or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). 

##### batches: `str`<a id="batches-str"></a>

The customer batches to include in the billing preview run. You can specify multiple batches separated by comma. If not specified, all customer batches are included.  **Note**:    - By default, you have 50 configurable account batches. To increase the limit to 200 batches, you must have the <a href=\\\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Performance_Booster_Elite\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Performance Booster Elite</a> package.   - This field is only available if you set the `zuora-version` request header to `314.0` or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version).

##### including_draft_items: `bool`<a id="including_draft_items-bool"></a>

Whether draft document items are included in the billing preview run. By default, draft document items are not included.  This field loads draft invoice items and credit memo items. The `chargeTypeToExclude`, `targetDate`, `includingEvergreenSubscription`, and `assumeRenewal` fields do not affect the behavior of the `includingDraftItems` field. 

##### including_evergreen_subscription: `bool`<a id="including_evergreen_subscription-bool"></a>

Whether evergreen subscriptions are included in the billing preview run. By default, evergreen subscriptions are not included. 

##### organization_labels: [`PostBillingPreviewRunParamOrganizationLabels`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/post_billing_preview_run_param_organization_labels.py)<a id="organization_labels-postbillingpreviewrunparamorganizationlabelszuora_python_sdktypepost_billing_preview_run_param_organization_labelspy"></a>

##### storage_option: `str`<a id="storage_option-str"></a>

The saving options. The default value is `Csv`. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_version: `str`<a id="zuora_version-str"></a>

 The minor version of the Zuora REST API. See [Minor Version](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version) for information about REST API version control.

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### description: `str`<a id="description-str"></a>

The description of the catalog group. 

##### name: `str`<a id="name-str"></a>

The unique name of the catalog group. 

##### product_rate_plans: List[`POSTorPUTCatalogGroupAddProductRatePlan`]<a id="product_rate_plans-listpostorputcataloggroupaddproductrateplan"></a>

The list of product rate plans to be added to the catalog group. 

##### type: `str`<a id="type-str"></a>

The type of the catalog group.  

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.credit_memos.apply_credit_memo`<a id="zuoracredit_memosapply_credit_memo"></a>

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.

Applies a posted credit memo to one or more invoices and debit memos. 

You can apply a credit memo to an invoice or a debit memo only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.

When you apply a credit memo, the total number of credit memo items and the items that credit memo items to be applied to must be less than or equal to 15,000.

If the limit is hit, you can follow the following instructions:

- If you want to apply one credit memo to multiple invoices or debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request.
- If you want to apply one credit memo to a single invoice or debit memo with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items or debit memo items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items or debit memo items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.
- If a credit memo has a large volume of items, you have to specify credit memo items in the request. The maximum number of credit memo items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.
        
If the Proration application rule is used, when applying credit memos, the following quantity must be less than or equal to 15,000: 

(number of invoice items + number of debit memo items) * number of credit memo items

Otherwise, the First In First Out rule will be used instead of the Proration rule.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
apply_credit_memo_response = zuora.credit_memos.apply_credit_memo(
    credit_memo_key="creditMemoKey_example",

Creates multiple credit memos from invoices or product rate plan charges. You can create a maximum of 50 credit memos in one single request. 

- If you set the `sourceType` request field to `Invoice`, you can create multiple credit memos from invoices.
- If you set the `sourceType` request field to `Standalone`, you can create multiple credit memos from product rate plan charges.

The credit memos that are created are each in separate database transactions. If the creation of one credit memo fails, other credit memos can still be created successfully. 

You can create credit memos only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.

Zero-amount memo items are supported in the following scenarios:
- If you want to correct taxation items only for an invoice, you can set the memo item amount to zero, but the taxation item amount to non-zero.
- If you want to correct personal data in an invoice, you can set the memo item amount to zero to create a zero-amount credit memo from an invoice.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
create_credit_memos_response = zuora.credit_memos.create_credit_memos(
    body={

##### credit_memo_key: `str`<a id="credit_memo_key-str"></a>

The unique ID or number of an credit memo. For example, 8a8082e65b27f6c3015ba45ff82c7172 or CM00000001. 

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### page_size: `int`<a id="page_size-int"></a>

The number of records returned per page in the response. 

##### page: `int`<a id="page-int"></a>

The index number of the page that you want to retrieve. This parameter is dependent on `pageSize`. You must set `pageSize` before specifying `page`. For example, if you set `pageSize` to `20` and `page` to `2`, the 21st to 40th records are returned in the response. 

#### 🔄 Return<a id="🔄-return"></a>

### Filtering<a id="filtering"></a>

You can use query parameters to restrict the data returned in the response. Each query parameter corresponds to one field in the response body.

If the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`. 

Examples:
    
  - /v1/creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100
  
  - /v1/creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100&sort=createdDate

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### page: `int`<a id="page-int"></a>

The index number of the page that you want to retrieve. This parameter is dependent on `pageSize`. You must set `pageSize` before specifying `page`. For example, if you set `pageSize` to `20` and `page` to `2`, the 21st to 40th records are returned in the response. 

##### page_size: `int`<a id="page_size-int"></a>

The number of records returned per page in the response. 

##### zuora_version: `str`<a id="zuora_version-str"></a>

 The minor version of the Zuora REST API. See [Minor Version](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version) for information about REST API version control.   This header affects the availability of the following response fields: * `items` > `creditTaxItems` * `items` > `taxationItems` * `items` > `comment` * `items` > `description` 

##### amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="amount-unionint-float"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `amount` field.  

##### applied_amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="applied_amount-unionint-float"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `appliedAmount` field. 

##### created_by_id: `str`<a id="created_by_id-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `createdById` field.  

##### created_date: `datetime`<a id="created_date-datetime"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `createdDate` field.  

##### id: `str`<a id="id-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `id` field.  

##### refund_amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="refund_amount-unionint-float"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `refundAmount` field.  

##### service_end_date: `date`<a id="service_end_date-date"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `serviceEndDate` field.  

##### service_start_date: `date`<a id="service_start_date-date"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `serviceStartDate` field.  

##### sku: `str`<a id="sku-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `sku` field.  

##### sku_name: `str`<a id="sku_name-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `skuName` field.  

##### source_item_id: `str`<a id="source_item_id-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `sourceItemId` field.  

##### subscription_id: `str`<a id="subscription_id-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `subscriptionId` field. 

##### updated_by_id: `str`<a id="updated_by_id-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `updatedById` field.  

##### updated_date: `datetime`<a id="updated_date-datetime"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `updatedDate` field. 

##### sort: `str`<a id="sort-str"></a>

This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.  A sortable field uses the following form:   *operator* *field_name*  You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*    *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.    - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.   - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.  By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by updated date.  *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:    - amount   - appliedAmount   - createdById   - createdDate   - id   - refundAmount   - serviceEndDate   - serviceStartDate   - sku   - skuName   - sourceItemId   - subscriptionId   - updatedById   - updatedDate      Examples:  - /v1/creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?sort=createdDate  - /v1/creditmemos/402890245c7ca371015c7cb40ac30015/items?amount=100&sort=createdDate

If the value of a filterable field is string, you can set the corresponding query parameter to `null` when filtering. Then, you can get the response data with this field value being `null`. 
  
Examples:

- /v1/creditmemos?status=Posted

- /v1/creditmemos?referredInvoiceId=null&status=Draft

- /v1/creditmemos?status=Posted&type=External&sort=+number

```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### page: `int`<a id="page-int"></a>

The index number of the page that you want to retrieve. This parameter is dependent on `pageSize`. You must set `pageSize` before specifying `page`. For example, if you set `pageSize` to `20` and `page` to `2`, the 21st to 40th records are returned in the response. 

##### page_size: `int`<a id="page_size-int"></a>

The number of records returned per page in the response. 

##### account_id: `str`<a id="account_id-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `accountId` field. 

##### account_number: `str`<a id="account_number-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `accountNumber` field. 

##### amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="amount-unionint-float"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `amount` field.  

##### applied_amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="applied_amount-unionint-float"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `appliedAmount` field.  

##### auto_apply_upon_posting: `bool`<a id="auto_apply_upon_posting-bool"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `autoApplyUponPosting` field.  

##### created_by_id: `str`<a id="created_by_id-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `createdById` field.  

##### created_date: `datetime`<a id="created_date-datetime"></a>

##### credit_memo_date: `date`<a id="credit_memo_date-date"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `creditMemoDate` field.  

##### currency: `str`<a id="currency-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `currency` field.  

##### exclude_from_auto_apply_rules: `bool`<a id="exclude_from_auto_apply_rules-bool"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `excludeFromAutoApplyRules` field.  

##### number: `str`<a id="number-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `number` field.  

##### referred_invoice_id: `str`<a id="referred_invoice_id-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `referredInvoiceId` field.  

##### refund_amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="refund_amount-unionint-float"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `refundAmount` field.  

##### status: `str`<a id="status-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `status` field.  

##### target_date: `date`<a id="target_date-date"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `targetDate` field.  

##### tax_amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="tax_amount-unionint-float"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `taxAmount` field.  

##### total_tax_exempt_amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="total_tax_exempt_amount-unionint-float"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `totalTaxExemptAmount` field. 

##### transferred_to_accounting: `str`<a id="transferred_to_accounting-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `transferredToAccounting` field.  

##### unapplied_amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="unapplied_amount-unionint-float"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `unappliedAmount` field.  

##### updated_by_id: `str`<a id="updated_by_id-str"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `updatedById` field.  

##### updated_date: `datetime`<a id="updated_date-datetime"></a>

This parameter filters the response based on the `updatedDate` field. 

##### sort: `str`<a id="sort-str"></a>

This parameter restricts the order of the data returned in the response. You can use this parameter to supply a dimension you want to sort on.  A sortable field uses the following form:   *operator* *field_name*  You can use at most two sortable fields in one URL path. Use a comma to separate sortable fields. For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*    *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.    - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.   - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.  By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by credit memo number.  *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field. The supported sortable fields of this operation are as below:    - accountId   - amount   - appliedAmount   - createdById   - createdDate   - creditMemoDate   - number   - referredInvoiceId   - refundAmount   - status   - targetDate   - taxAmount   - totalTaxExemptAmount   - transferredToAccounting   - unappliedAmount   - updatedDate       Examples:  - /v1/creditmemos?sort=+number  - /v1/creditmemos?status=Processed&sort=-number,+amount

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

Unapplies an applied credit memo from one or more invoices and debit memos. The full applied amount from invoices and debit memos is transferred into the unapplied amount of the credit memo. 

You can unapply a credit memo from an invoice or a debit memo only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.

When you unapply a credit memo, the total number of credit memo items and the items that credit memo items to be unapplied from must be less than or equal to 15,000.

If the limit is hit, you can follow the following instructions:

- If you want to unapply one credit memo without specifying invoices or debit memos and the limit is hit, you have to specify the invoice items or debit memo items in the request to decrease the number of items.
- If you want to unapply one credit memo from multiple specified invoices or debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request.
- If you want to unapply one credit memo from a single invoice or debit memo with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items or debit memo items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items or debit memo items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.
- If a credit memo has a large volume of items, you have to specify credit memo items in the request. The maximum number of credit memo items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.


If the Proration application rule is used, when unapplying credit memos, the following quantity must be less than or equal to 15,000: 

(number of invoice items + number of debit memo items) * number of credit memo items

Otherwise, the First In First Out rule will be used instead of the Proration rule.

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.custom_event_triggers.event_trigger`<a id="zuoracustom_event_triggersevent_trigger"></a>

When you create an event trigger, you must specify the base object and define the trigger condition.

### Specify the base object<a id="specify-the-base-object"></a>

Use `baseObject` field to specify which object to define a trigger on. You can define an event trigger on any of the following objects:
  
* Account
* AccountingCode
* AccountingPeriod
* Amendment
* BillingRun
* Contact
* CreditBalanceAdjustment
* CreditMemo
* CreditMemoApplication
* CreditMemoApplicationItem
* CreditMemoItem
* CreditMemoPart
* DebitMemo
* DebitMemoItem
* DeliveryAdjustment
* Feature
* Fulfillment
* Fund
* Invoice
* InvoiceAdjustment
* InvoiceItem
* InvoiceItemAdjustment
* JournalEntry
* JournalEntryItem
* Order
* OrderAction
* OrderLineItem
* Payment
* PaymentApplication
* PaymentMethod
* PaymentPart
* PaymentSchedule
* PaymentScheduleItem
* Product
* ProductFeature
* ProductRatePlan
* ProductRatePlanCharge
* ProductRatePlanChargeTier
* RatePlan
* RatePlanCharge
* RatePlanChargeTier
* RatingResult
* Refund
* RefundApplication
* RefundPart
* RevenueEvent
* RevenueEventItem
* RevenueSchedule
* RevenueScheduleItem
* Subscription
* SubscriptionChargeDeliverySchedule
* SubscriptionChargePriceInterval
* SubscriptionChargePriceIntervalTier
* SubscriptionOffer
* SubscriptionProductFeature
* TaxationItem
* UpdaterDetail
* Usage
* ValidityPeriodSummary
  
In addition to the above Zuora standard objects, you can also use custom objects as base objects for custom events.

#### Tenant level base objects and tenant level event triggers<a id="tenant-level-base-objects-and-tenant-level-event-triggers"></a>

Zuora identifies the following base objects and custom objects as the tenant level base objects:
  
* AccountingCode
* AccountingPeriod
* BillingRun
* Feature
* JournalEntry
* JournalEntryItem
* Product
* ProductFeature
* ProductRatePlan
* ProductRatePlanCharge
* ProductRatePlanChargeTier

Event triggers defined on tenant level base objects are tenant level event triggers. Notifications associated with tenant level events are system notifications.
  
**Note:** Tenant level event triggers and system notifications are only available in the default profile.

### Define the trigger condition<a id="define-the-trigger-condition"></a>

The `condition` field is a [JEXL](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/) expression that specifies when to trigger events. The expression can contain fields from the object that the trigger is defined on.

**Note:** The condition cannot contain fields from [data source](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL) objects that are joined to the object that the trigger is defined on.

For example, the following condition causes an event to be triggered whenever an invoice is posted with an amount greater than 1000:

  ```changeType == 'UPDATE' && Invoice.Status == 'Posted' && Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' && Invoice.Amount > 1000```

Where:

* `changeType` is a keyword that specifies the type of change that occurred to the Invoice object. For all objects, the supported values of `changeType` are `INSERT`, `UPDATE`,  and `DELETE`.
* `Invoice.Status` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field after the change occurred.
* `Invoice.Status_old` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field before the change occurred.

In the above example, the value of `baseObject` is `Invoice`.

#### Limitations<a id="limitations"></a>

This event trigger has the following limitations:
  
* Base object values for Zuora standard objects are case sensitive. For example, `PaymentMethod` is correct, and `Paymentmethod` or `paymentmethod` is incorrect.
* Base object values for custom objects must be lowercase. For example, `default__vehicle`.
* The INSERT change type is not supported on RatePlan base objects.
* The INSERT change type is not supported on SubscriptionProductFeature base objects.
* When creating custom events, you cannot match fields of the RatePlanCharge object against constant values for the `condition` field. For example, the following condition will cause errors: `RatePlanCharge.ShippingProcessStatus__c == 'Shipping Confirmed'`, where `Shipping Confirmed` is a constant value.
* Fields on objects are case-sensitive. For example, `PaymentMethod.createdbyid` can result in errors. The correct format is `PaymentMethod.CreatedById`.
* A condition cannot contain fields from data source objects that are joined to the base object.
* Do not create duplicate events because they will be either merged or deleted. Zuora considers events that have the same trigger condition as duplicate events, regardless of event type names.

See [Custom Events](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/Notifications/A_Z_Custom_Events) for more information.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
event_trigger_response = zuora.custom_event_triggers.event_trigger(
    active=True,
    base_object="Invoice",
    condition="changeType == 'UPDATE' && Invoice.Status == 'Posted' && Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' && Invoice.Amount > 1000",
    event_type={
        "description": "An invoice is posted with amount over 1000",
        "display_name": "Large Invoice Posted",
        "name": "LargeInvoicePosted",
    },
    authorization="Authorization_example",
    description="Trigger an event when an invoice is posted with amount over 1000",
    idempotency_key="string_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",

##### active: `bool`<a id="active-bool"></a>

The status of the event trigger.

##### base_object: `str`<a id="base_object-str"></a>

The base object that the trigger rule is defined upon. The format of the value in this field depends on the base object type: - Standard object: object name, which should follow the pattern ^[A-Z][\\\\w\\\\-]*$. For example, `Invoice`. - Custom object: `default__<custom_object_api_name>`. For example, `default__vehicle`. 

##### condition: `str`<a id="condition-str"></a>

The JEXL expression to be evaluated against object changes. See above for more information and an example.

##### event_type: [`EventType`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/event_type.py)<a id="event_type-eventtypezuora_python_sdktypeevent_typepy"></a>

### `zuora.custom_exchange_rates.custom_exchange_rates`<a id="zuoracustom_exchange_ratescustom_exchange_rates"></a>

This feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/). 

This reference describes how to query custom foreign exchange rates from Zuora. You can use this API method to query exchange rates only if you use a custom exchange rate provider and upload rates with the Import Foreign Exchange Rates mass action. 


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
custom_exchange_rates_response = zuora.custom_exchange_rates.custom_exchange_rates(
    currency="currency_example",
    start_date="startDate_example",
    end_date="endDate_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### currency: `str`<a id="currency-str"></a>

The target base currency of the tenant. The exchange rates in the response are calculated in relation to the target currency.  The value must be a three-letter currency code, for example, USD.  

##### start_date: `str`<a id="start_date-str"></a>

Start date of the date range for which you want to get exchange rates.  The date must be in yyyy-mm-dd format, for example, 2016-01-15. The start date cannot be later than the end date. 

##### end_date: `str`<a id="end_date-str"></a>

End date of the date range for which you want to get exchange rates.  The date must be in yyyy-mm-dd format, for example, 2016-01-16. The end date can be a maximum of 90 days after the start date. 

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.custom_object_definitions.custom_object_definitions`<a id="zuoracustom_object_definitionscustom_object_definitions"></a>

You can post custom object definitions with the request body schema described below. 

This operation also allows you to use the [List custom object definitions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/GET_AllCustomObjectDefinitionsInNamespace) response schema as its request schema. If you want to copy all the existing custom objects from an old tenant to a new tenant, you can make a [List custom object definitions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/GET_AllCustomObjectDefinitionsInNamespace) call in your old tenant and then use its response directly as the request of this operation in the new tenant to import all the custom objects from the old tenant.

The `label` field is the UI label of the custom object. The `object` field contains the API Name of the custom object.

### Limitations <a id="limitations-"></a>

This custom object definition has the following limitations:

* The maximum number of characters for the Custom Object API Name (`object`) is 64.
* The maximum number of characters for the Custom Object Label (`label`) is	64.
* The maximum number of characters for the Custom Object Description 250.
* The maximum number of custom fields in an custom object	is 50.
* The maximum number of characters for the custom field API name is	64.
* The maximum number of characters for the custom field label (`label`) is	64.
* The maximum number of characters for the custom field Description	is 250.
* The maximum number of picklist or multiselect options is 250.
* The default maximum number of characters for the Text field is 512. You can configure the max length up to 8,192 characters when creating or updating the custom object definition via API.
  However, if the Text field is filterable, the max length must be 512 or less.
* The maximum number of digits to the left of the decimal point for the Number field is 13, and to the right is 9.

Lists all custom object bulk jobs submitted by your tenant.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
all_custom_object_bulk_jobs_response = zuora.custom_object_jobs.all_custom_object_bulk_jobs(
    authorization="Authorization_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_version="1970-01-01",
    page_size=25,
    cursor="string_example",
    status="pending",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_version: `date`<a id="zuora_version-date"></a>

API version that determines the response schema. The default version is used if this parameter is not included. Specify `Zuora-Version` in the request header if you expect a specific response schema.

##### page_size: `int`<a id="page_size-int"></a>

The number of records returned per page in the response.

##### cursor: `str`<a id="cursor-str"></a>

The `cursor` points to the last job of the previous result set. The cursor job is not included in this query result. The call returns the first page if `cursor` is not provided and `pageSize` is valid.

##### status: `str`<a id="status-str"></a>

The status of bulk jobs to be retrieved.

### `zuora.custom_object_records.all_records_for_custom_object_type`<a id="zuoracustom_object_recordsall_records_for_custom_object_type"></a>

Lists all object records of the given type. You can also use the `q` query parameter to filter the output records.


### Custom Objects read consistency<a id="custom-objects-read-consistency"></a>

Custom Objects support eventually consistency. When you read custom object records, the response might not reflect the result of a recently completed operation and might include some stale data. The operations include creating, updating, and deleting custom object records.  If you repeat your read request after a short time, the response should return the latest data.

For example, if you create five records and perform a query that these five records satisfy the query conditions, there might be a delay before these records can be returned in the query result.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
all_records_for_custom_object_type_response = zuora.custom_object_records.all_records_for_custom_object_type(
    authorization="Authorization_example",
    object="object_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_version="1970-01-01",
    q="string_example",
    ids="string_example",
    page_size=1,
    cursor="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### object: `str`<a id="object-str"></a>

Specifies the custom object's API name as object. It is case-sensitive.

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_version: `date`<a id="zuora_version-date"></a>

API version that determines the response schema. The default version is used if this parameter is not included. Specify `Zuora-Version` in the request header if you expect a specific response schema.

##### q: `str`<a id="q-str"></a>

The query string to filter the records of a custom object. See the [Query syntax of custom object records](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Data_Model/Custom_object_records/Query_syntax_of_custom_object_records) for more information.  Note that the `q` parameter only applies to filterable fields. 

##### ids: `str`<a id="ids-str"></a>

UUIDs of the records to be queried. Each UUID must be a string of 36 characters. For example:  `GET /objects/records/default/passenger?ids=258d65b2-7bc6-4142-88bc-5184931af493&ids=82ecc9f7-b192-4f88-a4a3-4b2af6c750a1` 

##### page_size: `int`<a id="page_size-int"></a>

The number of records returned per page in the response.

##### cursor: `str`<a id="cursor-str"></a>

The `cursor` points to the last record of the previous result set. The cursor record is not included in the query result. The call returns the first page if `cursor` is not provided and `pageSize` is valid.

##### action: [`CustomObjectRecordBatchAction`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/custom_object_record_batch_action.py)<a id="action-customobjectrecordbatchactionzuora_python_sdktypecustom_object_record_batch_actionpy"></a>


##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### object: `str`<a id="object-str"></a>

Specifies the custom object's API name as object. It is case-sensitive.

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_version: `date`<a id="zuora_version-date"></a>

API version that determines the response schema. The default version is used if this parameter is not included. Specify `Zuora-Version` in the request header if you expect a specific response schema.

### `zuora.custom_object_records.partial_update_custom_object_record`<a id="zuoracustom_object_recordspartial_update_custom_object_record"></a>

Updates one or many fields of a custom object record. Patch update uses JSON Merge Patch as specified in [RFC 7386](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386).

### Limitations<a id="limitations"></a>

* The storage of empty strings in records is not supported.
* Null values must be formatted as the following example:
  ```
  {
    "records": [
      {
        "fieldName__c": null
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
* When creating or updating custom object records with relationship-type fields, Zuora verifies the related objects against the transactional databases, which are updated in near real-time. The record creation or modification fails upon unsuccessful verifications. <br />If the related objects are newly created in your tenant, it might need some time for the transactional database synchronization.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
partial_update_custom_object_record_response = zuora.custom_object_records.partial_update_custom_object_record(

)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### fields: List[`OpenPaymentMethodTypeRequestFields`]<a id="fields-listopenpaymentmethodtyperequestfields"></a>

An array containing field metadata of the custom payment method type.  Notes:   - All the following nested metadata must be provided in the request to define a field.    - At least one field must be defined in the fields array for a custom payment method type.    - Up to 20 fields can be defined in the fields array for a custom payment method type. 

##### internal_name: `str`<a id="internal_name-str"></a>

A string to identify the custom payment method type in the API name of the payment method type.  This field must be alphanumeric, starting with a capital letter, excluding JSON preserved characters such as  * \\\\ ’ ”. Additionally, '_' or '-' is not allowed.  This field must be unique in a tenant.  This field is used along with the `tenantId` field by the system to construct and generate the API name of the custom payment method type in the following way:  `<internalName>__c_<tenantId>`  For example, if `internalName` is `AmazonPay`, and `tenantId` is `12368`, the API name of the custom payment method type will be `AmazonPay__c_12368`.  This field cannot be updated after the creation of the custom payment method type. 

##### label: `str`<a id="label-str"></a>

The label that is used to refer to this type in the Zuora UI.  This value must be alphanumeric, excluding JSON preserved characters such as  * \\\\ ’ ”  

##### method_reference_id_field: `str`<a id="method_reference_id_field-str"></a>

An array containing field metadata of the custom payment method type.  Notes:   - All the following nested metadata fields must be provided in the request to define a field.    - At least one field must be defined in the fields array for a custom payment method type.    - Up to 20 fields can be defined in the fields array for a custom method type. 

##### internal_name: `str`<a id="internal_name-str"></a>

A string to identify the custom payment method type in the API name of the payment method type.  The value of this field must be the same as the value specified when creating the draft revision of this custom payment method type.  This field cannot be updated after the creation of the custom payment method type.  This field is used along with the `tenantId` field by the system to construct and generate the API name of the custom payment method type in the following way:  `<internalName>__c_<tenantId>`  For example, if `internalName` is `AmazonPay`, and `tenantId` is `12368`, the API name of the custom payment method type will be `AmazonPay__c_12368`. 

##### label: `str`<a id="label-str"></a>

The label that is used to refer to this type in the Zuora UI.  This value must be alphanumeric, excluding JSON preserved characters such as  * \\\\ ’ ”  

##### method_reference_id_field: `str`<a id="method_reference_id_field-str"></a>

The identification reference of the custom payment method.

    description="Trigger a scheduled event at 10:30 AM based on TermEndDate of subscription objects.",
    parameters={
        "key": {
            "value_type": "STRING",
        },
    },
    active=True,
    condition="Subscription.Status == _SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS",
    idempotency_key="string_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### api_field: `str`<a id="api_field-str"></a>

The base field of the base object in the `apiObject` field, should be in date or timestamp format. The scheduled event notifications are triggered based on this date and the event parameters (before or after a specified number of days) from notification definitions. Should be specified in the pattern: ^[A-Z][\\\\\\\\w\\\\\\\\-]*$   See [Custom Scheduled Events](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/Events_and_Notifications/A_Z_Custom_Scheduled_Events) for all available base fields. 

##### api_object: `str`<a id="api_object-str"></a>

The base object that the scheduled event is defined upon. The base object should contain a date or timestamp format field. Should be specified in the pattern: ^[A-Z][\\\\\\\\w\\\\\\\\-]*$             See [Custom Scheduled Events](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/Events_and_Notifications/A_Z_Custom_Scheduled_Events) for all available base objects. 

##### display_name: `str`<a id="display_name-str"></a>

The display name of the scheduled event.

##### hours: `int`<a id="hours-int"></a>

The scheduled time (hour) that the scheduled event notifications are sent. This time is based on the localized timezone of your tenant.

##### minutes: `int`<a id="minutes-int"></a>

The scheduled time (minute) that the scheduled event notifications are sent. This time is based on the localized timezone of your tenant.

##### name: `str`<a id="name-str"></a>

The name of the scheduled event. Should be unique, contain no space, and be in the pattern: ^[A-Za-z]{1,}[\\\\\\\\w\\\\\\\\-]*$

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### description: `str`<a id="description-str"></a>

The description of the scheduled event.

##### parameters: [`PostScheduledEventRequestParameters`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/post_scheduled_event_request_parameters.py)<a id="parameters-postscheduledeventrequestparameterszuora_python_sdktypepost_scheduled_event_request_parameterspy"></a>

##### active: `bool`<a id="active-bool"></a>

Indicate whether the scheduled event is active or inactive.

##### condition: `str`<a id="condition-str"></a>

The filter rule conditions, written in [JEXL](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/). The scheduled event is triggered only if the condition is evaluated as true. The rule might contain event context merge fields and data source merge fields. Data source merge fields must be from [the base object of the event or from the joined objects of the base object](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL#Data_Sources_and_Objects). Scheduled events with invalid merge fields will fail to evaluate, thus will not be triggered. For example, to trigger an invoice due date scheduled event to only invoices with an amount over 1000, you would define the following condition:  ```Invoice.Amount > 1000```  `Invoice.Amount` refers to the `Amount` field of the Zuora object `Invoice`. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).

### `zuora.data_labeling.data_labeling_job`<a id="zuoradata_labelingdata_labeling_job"></a>

Submits a data labeling job.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
data_labeling_job_response = zuora.data_labeling.data_labeling_job(
    object_type="Account",
    query_type="ByZoql",
    authorization="Authorization_example",
    ids=[
        "string_example"
    ],
    org_ids=[
        "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
    ],
    orgs=[
        "string_example"
    ],
    query="select Id from Account where BillToContact.Country = 'US'",
    idempotency_key="string_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### object_type: `str`<a id="object_type-str"></a>

The object type of the data labeling job.  Currently, the following objects are supported:   * `User`   * `Account`       All the associated transaction objects of the account being labeled will automatically inherit the org label of the account.   * `Product`      You have to label the Account object first, make sure all accounts have been labeled, then you can proceed with the Product object.       You can get all the unlabeled accounts by running a Data Source export job, with the following query:     ``` sql     SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Organization.Id IS NULL     ```                        All the ProductRatePlanS of the product will be automatically labeled with the same `orgs`.          When labeling products, you can omit the `orgs` parameter, i.e, leave it empty, the system will find all the subscriptions that include the product and get the org list of those subscriptions, then label the product with those `orgs`, aka, the `derived orgs`.          You can also explicitly specify the orgs parameter, in that case, you will need to provide a super set of the `derived orgs`.     * `BillRun`      You don't need to specify the `orgs` parameter, we will label the `BillRun` with all the orgs because existing runs could pick up all accounts. You can definitely create new bill run with certain `orgs` to operate separately by `orgs`.   * `PaymentRun`      Same as BillRun.   * `ForecastRun` 

##### query_type: `str`<a id="query_type-str"></a>

Specifies the type of query that the data labeling job will run to fetch the data to be labeled.  * `ByZoql` - The data labeling job will run a ZOQL query which is specified in the `query` field to fetch the data to be labeled. * `ById` - The data labeling job will fetch the data to be labeled by the IDs specified in the `ids` field. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken).

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. 

Updates the basic and finance information about a debit memo. Currently, Zuora supports updating tax-exclusive memo items, but does not support updating tax-inclusive memo items. 

If the amount of a memo item is updated, the tax will be recalculated in the following conditions:
  - The memo is created from a product rate plan charge and you use Avalara to calculate the tax.
  - The memo is created from an invoice and you use Avalara or Zuora Tax to calculate the tax.

You can update a debit memo only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.

This API operation provides an easy way to let the client-side to collect an existing posted debit memo.
It supports the following steps:
  1. Apply unapplied credit memos to the posted debit memo by Oldest-First-Largest-First rule if there are more than one unapplied credit memos.
  2. Apply unapplied payments to the posted debit memo by Oldest-First-Largest-First rule if there are more than one unapplied payments.
  3. Process payment to the posted debit memo if there is an open-balance on it.

**Restrictions**

Since this API will do lots of works, and some of them are resource consuming, we need to restrict the usage of this API by the following conditions:
  1. If the target debit memo gets more than 10 debit memo items, the request will be rejected.
  2. If `CreditMemo` is specified in `applicationOrder`, when there are more than 25 credit memos will be used to apply to the debit memo, the request will be rejected.
  3. If `CreditMemo` is specified in `applicationOrder`, when there are more than 100 credit memo items will be used to apply to the debit memo, the request will be rejected.
  4. If `UnappliedPayment` is specified in `applicationOrder`, when there are more than 25 payments will be used to apply to the debit memo, the request will be rejected.

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

Updates the basic and finance information about multiple debit memos.  You can update a maximum of 50 credit memos in one single request.
  
The credit memos that are updated are each in separate database transactions. If the update of one debit memo fails, other debit memos can still be updated successfully.

Currently, Zuora supports updating tax-exclusive memo items, but does not support updating tax-inclusive memo items.

If the amount of a memo item is updated, the tax will be recalculated in the following conditions:
  - The memo is created from a product rate plan charge and you use Avalara to calculate the tax.
  - The memo is created from an invoice and you use Avalara or Zuora Tax to calculate the tax.

You can update debit memos only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### debit_memos: List[`BatchDebitMemoType`]<a id="debit_memos-listbatchdebitmemotype"></a>

Container for debit memo update details. 

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### adjustment_id: `str`<a id="adjustment_id-str"></a>

The ID of the delivery adjustment to cancel. 

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.describe.describe`<a id="zuoradescribedescribe"></a>

Provides a reference listing of each object that is available in your Zuora tenant.

The information returned by this call is useful if you are using [CRUD: Create Export](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/Object_POSTExport) or the [AQuA API](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/T_Aggregate_Query_API) to create a data source export. See [Export ZOQL](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL) for more information.

### Response<a id="response"></a>
The response contains an XML document that lists the fields of the specified object. Each of the object's fields is represented by a `<field>` element in the XML document.
    
Each `<field>` element contains the following elements:

| Element      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<name>`     | API name of the field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `<label>`    | Name of the field in the Zuora user interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `<type>`     | Data type of the field. The possible data types are: `boolean`, `date`, `datetime`, `decimal`, `integer`, `picklist`, `text`, `timestamp`, and `ZOQL`. If the data type is `picklist`, the `<field>` element contains an `<options>` element that lists the possible values of the field.    |
| `<contexts>` | Specifies the availability of the field. If the `<contexts>` element lists the `export` context, the field is available for use in data source exports.                                                                                                                                                |

The `<field>` element contains other elements that provide legacy information about the field. This information is not directly related to the REST API.

Response sample:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<object>
  <name>ProductRatePlanCharge</name>
  <label>Product Rate Plan Charge</label>
  <fields>
    ...
    <field>
      <name>TaxMode</name>
      <label>Tax Mode</label>
      <type>picklist</type>
      <options>
        <option>TaxExclusive</option>
        <option>TaxInclusive</option>
      </options>
      <contexts>
        <context>export</context>
      </contexts>
      ...
    </field>
    ...
  </fields>
</object>
```

It is strongly recommended that your integration checks `<contexts>` elements in the response. If your integration does not check `<contexts>` elements, your integration may process fields that are not available for use in data source exports.

With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.

### `zuora.imports.g_et_import`<a id="zuoraimportsg_et_import"></a>

CRUD: Retrieve an import

#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
g_et_import_response = zuora.imports.g_et_import(
    id="id_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    fields="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### id: `str`<a id="id-str"></a>

Object id

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### fields: `str`<a id="fields-str"></a>

Object fields to return

### `zuora.invoice_schedules.pause_invoice_schedule`<a id="zuorainvoice_schedulespause_invoice_schedule"></a>

Pauses an invoice schedule immediately.

After one invoice schedule is paused, it cannot be automatically executed by Zuora
Scheduler or by the [Execute an invoice schedule](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_ExecuteInvoiceSchedule/)
API operation.


If you want to run a paused invoice schedule, you can create a bill run with the
target date greater than the next run date of the invoice schedule.

**Note**: This operation is available only if you have the <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Bill_your_customers/Billing_Schedule/Billing_Schedule_overview" target="_blank">Billing Schedule</a> feature enabled.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
pause_invoice_schedule_response = zuora.invoice_schedules.pause_invoice_schedule(
    schedule_key="scheduleKey_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### invoices: List[`PostInvoiceType`]<a id="invoices-listpostinvoicetype"></a>

Container for standalone invoices. 

##### use_single_transaction: `bool`<a id="use_single_transaction-bool"></a>

Whether a batch request is handled with a single transaction.  - `true` indicates that a batch request will be handled with a single transaction. - `false`  indicates that the standalone invoices to be created in a batch request will be handled with separated transactions.  If the field is set to `false`, a failure in the batch request will not cause the whole request to fail, so you have to retry the whole batch request. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.invoices.write_off_invoice`<a id="zuorainvoiceswrite_off_invoice"></a>

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.

Writes off a posted invoice. 

By writing off an invoice, a credit memo is created and applied to the invoice. The generated credit memo items and credit memo taxation items are applied to invoice items and invoice taxation items based on the configured default application rule. If an invoice is written off, the balance of each invoice item and invoice taxation item must be zero.

If you set the **Create credit memos mirroring invoice items billing rule** to **Yes**, you can write off an invoice even if all its items have zero balance.

**Restrictions**: You cannot write off an invoice if any of the following restrictions is met:
* The balance of an invoice has been changed before Invoice Settlement is enabled.
  For example, before Invoice Settlement is enabled, any credit balance adjustments, invoice item adjustments, or invoice adjustments have been applied to an invoice.
* An invoice contains more than 2,000 items in total, including invoice items, discount items, and taxation items.
See [Invoice Write-off](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/IA_Invoices/Invoice_Write-Off) for more information.

The target start date of the journal run.  Required if you include targetEndDate.  If you include `accountingPeriodName`, the `targetStartDate` must be empty or the same as the start date of the accounting period specified in `accountingPeriodName`. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.journal_runs.journal_run_2`<a id="zuorajournal_runsjournal_run_2"></a>

This reference describes how to cancel a journal run using the REST API.
          
The summary journal entries in the journal run are canceled asynchronously. See the "Example" section below for details.
          
You must have the "Cancel Journal Run" Zuora Finance user permission enabled to cancel journal runs.

### Notes<a id="notes"></a>
When you cancel a journal run, the summary journal entries associated with that journal run are canceled asynchronously. A response of `{ "success": true }` means only that the specified journal run has a status of "Pending", "Error", or "Completed" and therefore can be canceled, but does not mean that the whole journal run was successfully canceled.

For example, let's say you want to cancel journal run JR-00000075. The journal run status is "Completed" and it contains ten journal entries. One of the journal entries has its Transferred to Accounting status set to "Yes", meaning that the entry cannot be canceled. The workflow might go as follows:
1. You make an API call to cancel the journal run.
2. The journal run status is "Completed", so you receive a response of `{ "success": true }`.
3. Zuora begins asynchronously canceling journal entries associated with the journal run. The journal entry whose Transferred to Accounting status is "Yes" fails to be canceled. The cancelation process continues, and the other journal entries are successfully canceled.
4. The journal run status remains as "Completed". The status does not change to "Canceled" because the journal run still contains a journey entry that is not canceled.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
journal_run_2_response = zuora.journal_runs.journal_run_2(
    jr_number="jr-number_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### jr_number: `str`<a id="jr_number-str"></a>

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.notifications.create_notification_definition`<a id="zuoranotificationscreate_notification_definition"></a>

Creates a notification definition. If a filter rule is specified, it will be evaluated to see if the notification definition is qualified to handle the incoming events during runtime. If the notification is qualified, it will send the email and invoke the callout if it has an email template or a callout.

This operation supports creating notification definitions for all event types:

- To create a notification definition for a standard event, you must specify the `eventCategory` field. For more information about standard event category codes, see <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Events_and_Notifications/A_Standard_Events/Standard_Event_Category_Code_for_Events_and_Notifications" target="_blank">Standard event category code for events and notifications</a>.
- To create a notification definition for a Zuora custom event, custom event, or custom scheduled event, you must specify the `eventTypeName` field. For more information, see <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Events_and_Notifications/A_C_Zuora_Custom_Events" target="_blank">Zuora custom events</a>, [Custom event triggers](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/tag/Custom-Event-Triggers/), and [Custom scheduled events](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/tag/Custom-Scheduled-Events/).
  
You must specify either `eventCategory` or `eventTypeName`, but not both at the same time.

### `zuora.o_auth.create_token`<a id="zuorao_authcreate_token"></a>

Creates a bearer token that enables an OAuth client to authenticate with the Zuora REST API. The OAuth client must have been created using the Zuora UI. See [Authentication](https://developer.zuora.com/rest-api/general-concepts/authentication/) for more information.

**Note:** When using this operation, do not set any authentication headers such as `Authorization`, `apiAccessKeyId`, or `apiSecretAccessKey`.

You should not use this operation to generate a large number of bearer tokens in a short period of time; each token should be used until it expires. If you receive a 429 Too Many Requests response when using this operation, reduce the frequency of requests. This endpoint is rate limited by IP address.

For the rate limit information of authentication, see [Rate and concurrent request limits](https://developer.zuora.com/rest-api/general-concepts/rate-concurrency-limits/).


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
create_token_response = zuora.o_auth.create_token(
    client_id="aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
    client_secret="string_example",
    grant_type="client_credentials",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### client_id: `str`<a id="client_id-str"></a>

The Client ID of the OAuth client.

### `zuora.operations.billing_preview`<a id="zuoraoperationsbilling_preview"></a>


Generates a preview of future invoice items for one customer account. Use the BillingPreview call to calculate how much a single customer will be invoiced from the most recent invoice to a specific end of term date in the future.

Additionally, you can use the BillingPreview service to access real-time data on an individual customer's usage consumption. 

The BillingPreview call only calculates taxes for charges in the subscription if you use [Zuora Tax](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Taxes/A_Zuora_Tax) and the product rate plan charge associated with the invoice item uses the [tax inclusive mode](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Taxes/A_Zuora_Tax/D_Associate_tax_codes_with_product_charges_and_set_the_tax_mode); otherwise, this call does not calculate taxes.

If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, you can also generate a preview of future credit memo items for one customer account. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. 


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python

    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### target_date: `date`<a id="target_date-date"></a>

The target date for the billingPreview call. The billingPreview call generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the TargetDate.   If the TargetDate is later than the subscription current term end date, the preview invoice item data and credit memo item data is generated from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the current term end date. If you want to generate preview invoice item data and credit memo item data past the end of the subscription current term, specify the `AssumeRenewal` field in the request.   **Note:** The credit memo item data is only available if you have Invoice Settlement feature enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. 

##### account_id: `str`<a id="account_id-str"></a>

The ID of the customer account to which the billing preview applies.  **Note**: When posting billing preview, you must specify either `accountId` or `accountNumber` in the request body. 

##### account_number: `str`<a id="account_number-str"></a>

The number of the customer account to which the billing preview applies.  **Note**: When posting billing preview, you must specify either `accountId` or `accountNumber` in the request body. 

##### assume_renewal: `str`<a id="assume_renewal-str"></a>

Indicates whether to generate a preview of future invoice items and credit memo items with the assumption that the subscriptions are renewed.  Set one of the following values in this field to decide how the assumption is applied in the billing preview.    * **All:** The assumption is applied to all the subscriptions. Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the target date.      * **None:** (Default) The assumption is not applied to the subscriptions. Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data based on the current term end date and the target date.        * If the target date is later than the current term end date, Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the current term end date.      * If the target date is earlier than the current term end date, Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the target date.    * **Autorenew:** The assumption is applied to the subscriptions that have auto-renew enabled. Zuora generates preview invoice item data and credit memo item data from the first day of the customer's next billing period to the target date.  **Note:**    - This field can only be used if the subscription renewal term is not set to 0.           - The credit memo item data is only available if you have Invoice Settlement feature enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. 

##### charge_type_to_exclude: `str`<a id="charge_type_to_exclude-str"></a>

The charge types to exclude from the billing preview.  **Possible values:** OneTime, Recurring, Usage, and any combination of these values. 

##### including_draft_items: `bool`<a id="including_draft_items-bool"></a>

Whether draft document items are included in the billing preview run. By default, draft document items are not included.  This field loads draft invoice items and credit memo items. The `chargeTypeToExclude`, `targetDate`, `includingEvergreenSubscription`, and `assumeRenewal` fields do not affect the behavior of the `includingDraftItems` field.           

##### including_evergreen_subscription: `bool`<a id="including_evergreen_subscription-bool"></a>

Indicates if evergreen subscriptions are included in the billingPreview call. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.operations.transaction_invoice_payment`<a id="zuoraoperationstransaction_invoice_payment"></a>

Generates and posts invoices and credit memos and collects payments for posted invoices. Credit memos are only available if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled and negative charges exist. Credit memos will not be applied to invoices. If draft invoices and credit memos exist when you run this operation, this operation will post the invoices and credit memos. Note that draft credit memos created from an invoice or a product rate plan charge will not be posted.

You can use this operation to generate invoices and collect payments on the posted invoices,
 or else simply collect payment on a specified existing
invoice. The customer's default payment method is used, and the full
amount due is collected. The operation depends on the parameters you
specify.

- To generate one or more new invoices for that customer and collect
payment on the generated and other unpaid invoice(s), leave the **invoiceId** field empty. 

- To collect payment on an existing invoice, specify the invoice ID. 


The operation is atomic; if any part is unsuccessful, the entire
operation is rolled back.

When an error occurs, gateway reason codes and error messages are returned the error response of this operation. The following items are some gateway response code examples.

- Orbital: `05 Do Not Honor`; `14 Invalid Credit Card Number`
- Vantiv: `301 Invalid Account Number`; `304 Lost/Stolen Card`  
- CyberSource2: `202 Expired card`; `231 Invalid account number`

For more reason code information, see the corresponding payment gateway documentation.

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_version: `str`<a id="zuora_version-str"></a>

 The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   You need to set this parameter if you use the following fields: * documentDate * targetDate              If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, you need to specify this parameter.

You can update this field only for a sales OLI and only when the sales OLI is in the `Executing` state (when the `itemState` field is set as `Executing`).  Use this field in accordance with the `inlineDiscountType` field, in the following manner: * If the `inlineDiscountType` field is set as `Percentage`, this field specifies the discount percentage for each unit of the order line item. For exmaple, if you specify `5` in this field, the discount percentage is 5%. * If the `inlineDiscountType` field is set as `FixedAmount`, this field specifies the discount amount on each unit of the order line item. For exmaple, if you specify `10` in this field, the discount amount on each unit of the order line item is 10.  Once you set the `inlineDiscountType`, `inlineDiscountPerUnit`, and `listPricePerUnit` fields, the system will automatically generate the `amountPerUnit` field. You shall not set the `amountPerUnit` field by yourself. 

##### inline_discount_type: `str`<a id="inline_discount_type-str"></a>

##### description: `str`<a id="description-str"></a>

A description of the order.

##### category: `str`<a id="category-str"></a>

Category of the order to indicate a product sale or return. Default value is `NewSales`. 

##### custom_fields: [`OrderObjectCustomFields`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/order_object_custom_fields.py)<a id="custom_fields-orderobjectcustomfieldszuora_python_sdktypeorder_object_custom_fieldspy"></a>

##### existing_account_number: `str`<a id="existing_account_number-str"></a>

The account number that this order will be created under. Note that this actually specifies the invoice owner account of the subscriptions included in this order. 

##### externally_managed_by: `str`<a id="externally_managed_by-str"></a>

An enum field on the Subscription object to indicate the name of a third-party store. This field is used to represent subscriptions created through third-party stores. 

##### new_account: `CreateOrderNewAccount`<a id="new_account-createordernewaccount"></a>

##### order_line_items: List[`OrderLineItemCommonPostOrder`]<a id="order_line_items-listorderlineitemcommonpostorder"></a>

[Order Line Items](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AA_Overview_of_Order_Line_Items) are non subscription based items created by an Order, representing transactional charges such as one-time fees, physical goods, or professional service charges that are not sold as subscription services.   With the Order Line Items feature enabled, you can now launch non-subscription and unified monetization business models in Zuora, in addition to subscription business models.  **Note:** The [Order Line Items](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AA_Overview_of_Order_Line_Items) feature is now generally available to all Zuora customers. You need to enable the [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders#Orders) feature to access the [Order Line Items](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AA_Overview_of_Order_Line_Items) feature. As of Zuora Billing Release 313 (November 2021), new customers who onboard on [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders) will have the [Order Line Items](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items) feature enabled by default.         

##### order_number: `str`<a id="order_number-str"></a>

The order number of the new order. If not provided, system will auto-generate a number for this order.    **Note:** Make sure the order number does not contain a slash. 

##### processing_options: [`ProcessingOptionsOrdersAsync`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/processing_options_orders_async.py)<a id="processing_options-processingoptionsordersasynczuora_python_sdktypeprocessing_options_orders_asyncpy"></a>


##### reason_code: `str`<a id="reason_code-str"></a>

Values of reason code configured in **Billing Settings** > **Configure Reason Codes** through Zuora UI. Indicates the reason when a return order line item occurs. 

##### subscriptions: [`POSTOrderAsyncRequestTypeSubscriptions`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/post_order_async_request_type_subscriptions.py)<a id="subscriptions-postorderasyncrequesttypesubscriptionszuora_python_sdktypepost_order_async_request_type_subscriptionspy"></a>

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### return_ids: `bool`<a id="return_ids-bool"></a>

Specify whether to return IDs for the [Get job status and response](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/GET_JobStatusAndResponse) operation. If you set this query parameter to `true`, the corresponding IDs, which are associated with the numbers returned in this operation, can be returned in the \"Get job status and response\" response body. 

##### zuora_version: `str`<a id="zuora_version-str"></a>

 The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   You need to set this parameter if you want to use the following fields: * subscriptions * subscriptionNumbers * subscriptionIds (when the `returnId` query parameter is set to `true`) 

#### ⚙️ Request Body<a id="⚙️-request-body"></a>

[`POSTOrderAsyncRequestType`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/post_order_async_request_type.py)
#### 🔄 Return<a id="🔄-return"></a>

You can also use this operation to create orders and save the orders as scehduled orders. To manage and access the <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Manage_subscription_transactions/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders/P_Scheduled_Orders" target="_blank">Scheduled Orders</a> feature from the self-service interface, see <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Configure_billing_settings/System_settings/Enable_billing_features_by_yourself" target="_blank">Enable billing features by yourself</a>.

In addition, you can use this operation to place a standalone order to subscribe without pre-defining a product catalog in Zuora Billing. For more information, see <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Manage_subscription_transactions/Orders/Standalone_Orders/Create_a_subscription_using_a_standalone_order" target="_blank">Create a subscription using a standalone order</a>. The <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Manage_subscription_transactions/Orders/Standalone_Orders/AA_Overview_of_Standalone_Orders" target="_blank">Standalone Orders</a> feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. If you want to join this early adopter program, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com).

**Note:** If you received a timeout error message when creating an order, the call is still running in the backend and the order will be created.

The limit of orders allowed on a subscription is 1000.

The limit of order line items allowed in an order is 100.

Zuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent performance degradation: 
* Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.
* Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.
* Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_Order) or [Preview an order](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.

If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations:
* [Create an order asynchronously](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously)
* [Preview an order asynchronously](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)
* [Retrieve the status and response of a job](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/GET_JobStatusAndResponse) for checking the status of the asynchronous API operations

Zuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation:
* Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.
* Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order asynchronously](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.
* Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create an order asynchronously](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview an order asynchronously](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.


**Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order action), if in the same "Create an order" call you are to perform other subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action). 

**Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if any error occurs during the call, such as a payment processing failure and a tax engine failure, then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be created, and the account will not be created.

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### return_ids: `bool`<a id="return_ids-bool"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### page: `int`<a id="page-int"></a>

The index number of the page that you want to retrieve. This parameter is dependent on `pageSize`. You must set `pageSize` before specifying `page`. For example, if you set `pageSize` to `20` and `page` to `2`, the 21st to 40th records are returned in the response. 

##### page_size: `int`<a id="page_size-int"></a>

The number of records returned per page in the response. 

##### date_filter_option: `str`<a id="date_filter_option-str"></a>

The date type to filter on. This field value can be 'orderDate' or 'updatedDate'. Default is orderDate. 

##### start_date: `date`<a id="start_date-date"></a>

The result will only contain the orders with the date of 'dateFilterOption' later than or equal to this date. 

##### end_date: `date`<a id="end_date-date"></a>

The result will only contain the orders with the date of 'dateFilterOption' earlier than or equal to this date.

##### existing_account_number: `str`<a id="existing_account_number-str"></a>

The account number that this order will be created under.  Note that invoice owner account of the subscriptions included in this order should be the same with the account of the order. 

##### order_line_items: List[`OrderLineItemCommonPostOrder`]<a id="order_line_items-listorderlineitemcommonpostorder"></a>

[Order Line Items](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AA_Overview_of_Order_Line_Items) are non subscription based items created by an Order, representing transactional charges such as one-time fees, physical goods, or professional service charges that are not sold as subscription services.   With the Order Line Items feature enabled, you can now launch non-subscription and unified monetization business models in Zuora, in addition to subscription business models.   **Note:** The [Order Line Items](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AA_Overview_of_Order_Line_Items) feature is now generally available to all Zuora customers. You need to enable the [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders#Orders) feature to access the [Order Line Items](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/AA_Overview_of_Order_Line_Items) feature. As of Zuora Billing Release 313 (November 2021), new customers who onboard on [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders) will have the [Order Line Items](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items) feature enabled by default.        

##### order_number: `str`<a id="order_number-str"></a>

The order number of this order.    **Note:** Make sure the order number does not contain a slash. 

##### preview_account_info: [`PreviewAccountInfo`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/preview_account_info.py)<a id="preview_account_info-previewaccountinfozuora_python_sdktypepreview_account_infopy"></a>

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

#### ⚙️ Request Body<a id="⚙️-request-body"></a>

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

##### amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="amount-unionint-float"></a>

The amount of the payment.  This field is required if `processPayment` is `true`. 

##### auth_amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="auth_amount-unionint-float"></a>

The authorization amount for the payment method. Specify a value greater than 0.  This field is required if `processPayment` is false. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.payment_methods.create_stored_credential_profile`<a id="zuorapayment_methodscreate_stored_credential_profile"></a>

Creates a stored credential profile within a payment method.

The stored credential profile represents a consent agreement that you have established with a customer. When you use the payment method in a transaction, Zuora may include information from the stored credential profile to inform the payment processor that the transaction is related to your pre-existing consent agreement with the customer.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
create_stored_credential_profile_response = zuora.payment_methods.create_stored_credential_profile(
    consent_agreement_src="External",
    status="Active",
    type="Recurring",
    payment_method_id="payment-method-id_example",
    action="Activate",
    agreed_on="1970-01-01",
    auth_gateway="4028905f5702783601570291e14c0015",
    card_security_code="string_example",
    consent_agreement_ref="ACCT1338AgreementV1.pdf",
    network_transaction_id="string_example",
    idempotency_key="string_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### consent_agreement_src: `str`<a id="consent_agreement_src-str"></a>

Specifies how the consent agreement has been established with the customer. The allowed value is `External`. 

##### status: `str`<a id="status-str"></a>

Specifies the status of the stored credential profile.  - `Active` - Use this value if you are creating the stored credential profile after receiving the customer's consent, or if the stored credential profile represents a stored credential profile in an external system.    You can use the `action` field to specify how Zuora activates the stored credential profile.   - `Agreed` - Use this value if you are migrating the payment method to the stored credential transaction framework.    In this case, Zuora will not send a cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) to the payment gateway to validate the stored credential profile. 

##### type: `str`<a id="type-str"></a>

Indicates the type of the stored credential profile to process recurring or unsecheduled transactions. 

##### payment_method_id: `str`<a id="payment_method_id-str"></a>

ID of a payment method. 

##### action: `str`<a id="action-str"></a>

Specifies how Zuora activates the stored credential profile. Only applicable if you set the `status` field to `Active`.  - `Activate` (default) - Use this value if you are creating the stored credential profile after receiving the customer's consent.    Zuora will create the stored credential profile then send a cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) to the payment gateway to validate the stored credential profile. If the CIT succeeds, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Active`. If the CIT does not succeed, Zuora will not create a stored credential profile.      If the payment gateway does not support the stored credential transaction framework, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Agreed`.   - `Persist` - Use this value if the stored credential profile represents a stored credential profile in an external system. The status of the payment method's stored credential profile will be `Active`. 

##### agreed_on: `date`<a id="agreed_on-date"></a>

The date on which the profile is agreed. The date format is `yyyy-mm-dd`. 

##### auth_gateway: `str`<a id="auth_gateway-str"></a>

Specifies the ID of the payment gateway that Zuora will use when activating the stored credential profile.

The field used to pass gateway-specific parameters and parameter values. The fields supported by gateways vary. For more information, see the Overview topic of each gateway integration in [Zuora Knowledge Center](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Billing_and_Payments/M_Payment_Gateways/Supported_Payment_Gateways).  Zuora sends all the information that you specified to the gateway. If you specify any unsupported gateway option parameters, they will be ignored without error prompts.  This field is not supported in updating Credit Card Reference Transaction payment methods. 

##### ip_address: `str`<a id="ip_address-str"></a>

The IPv4 or IPv6 information of the user when the payment method is created or updated. Some gateways use this field for fraud prevention. If this field is passed to Zuora, Zuora directly passes it to gateways.   If the IP address length is beyond 45 characters, a validation error occurs.  For validating SEPA payment methods on Stripe v2, this field is required. 

##### mandate_info: [`Dict[str, Union[bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, None]]`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/typing_dict_str_typing_union_bool_date_datetime_dict_float_int_list_str_none.py)<a id="mandate_info-dictstr-unionbool-date-datetime-dict-float-int-list-str-nonezuora_python_sdktypetyping_dict_str_typing_union_bool_date_datetime_dict_float_int_list_str_nonepy"></a>

The container for payment method processing options. 

##### expiration_month: `int`<a id="expiration_month-int"></a>

One or two digits expiration month (1-12).          

##### expiration_year: `int`<a id="expiration_year-int"></a>

Four-digit expiration year. 

##### security_code: `str`<a id="security_code-str"></a>

Optional. It is the CVV or CVV2 security code specific for the credit card or debit card. To ensure PCI compliance, this value is not stored and cannot be queried.   If securityCode code is not passed in the request payload, this operation only updates related fields in the payload. It does not validate the payment method through the gateway.  If securityCode is passed in the request payload, this operation retrieves the credit card information from payload and validates them through the gateway. 

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### type: `str`<a id="type-str"></a>

##### card_holder_info: [`CreatePaymentMethodCardholderInfo`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/create_payment_method_cardholder_info.py)<a id="card_holder_info-createpaymentmethodcardholderinfozuora_python_sdktypecreate_payment_method_cardholder_infopy"></a>


##### card_number: `str`<a id="card_number-str"></a>

Credit card number. 

##### card_type: `str`<a id="card_type-str"></a>

The type of the credit card. Possible values include `Visa`, `MasterCard`, `AmericanExpress`, `Discover`, `JCB`, and `Diners`. For more information about credit card types supported by different payment gateways, see [Supported Payment Gateways](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/M_Payment_Gateways/Supported_Payment_Gateways). 

##### check_duplicated: `bool`<a id="check_duplicated-bool"></a>

Indicates whether the duplication check is performed when you create a new credit card payment method. The default value is `false`.  With this field set to `true`, Zuora will check all active payment methods associated with the same billing account to ensure that no duplicate credit card payment methods are created. An error is returned if a duplicate payment method is found.          The following fields are used for the duplication check:   - `cardHolderName`   - `expirationMonth`   - `expirationYear`   - `creditCardMaskNumber`. It is the masked credit card number generated by Zuora. For example, `************1234`.  **This field is being deprecated.**  To achieve the same purpose, use the `processingOptions` > `checkDuplicated` field of the payment method object. 

##### expiration_month: `int`<a id="expiration_month-int"></a>

One or two digit expiration month (1-12) of the credit card. 

##### expiration_year: `int`<a id="expiration_year-int"></a>

Four-digit expiration year of the credit card.

The identity number used for Bank Transfer. 

##### mit_consent_agreement_ref: `str`<a id="mit_consent_agreement_ref-str"></a>

Specifies your reference for the stored credential consent agreement that you have established with the customer. Only applicable if you set the `mitProfileAction` field. 

##### mit_consent_agreement_src: `str`<a id="mit_consent_agreement_src-str"></a>

Required if you set the `mitProfileAction` field. Specifies how the consent agreement has been established with the customer. The allowed value is `External`. If you do not specify the `mitProfileAction` field, Zuora will automatically create a stored credential profile for the payment method, with the default value `External` set to this field. 

##### mit_network_transaction_id: `str`<a id="mit_network_transaction_id-str"></a>

Specifies the ID of a network transaction. Only applicable if you set the `mitProfileAction` field to `Persist`. 

##### mit_profile_action: `str`<a id="mit_profile_action-str"></a>

Specifies how Zuora creates and activates the stored credential profile.  - `Activate` - Use this value if you are creating the stored credential profile after receiving the customer's consent.    Zuora will create the stored credential profile then send a cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) to the payment gateway to validate the stored credential profile. If the CIT succeeds, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Active`. If the CIT does not succeed, Zuora will not create a stored credential profile.      If the payment gateway does not support the stored credential transaction framework, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Agreed`.   - `Persist` - Use this value if the stored credential profile represents a stored credential profile in an external system. The status of the payment method's stored credential profile will be `Active`.  If you do not specify this field, Zuora will automatically create a stored credential profile for the payment method, with the default value `Activate` set to this field. 

##### mit_profile_agreed_on: `date`<a id="mit_profile_agreed_on-date"></a>

The date on which the profile is agreed. The date format is `yyyy-mm-dd`. 

##### mit_profile_type: `str`<a id="mit_profile_type-str"></a>

Required if you set the `mitProfileAction` field. Indicates the type of the stored credential profile to process recurring or unsecheduled transactions.

##### account_key: `str`<a id="account_key-str"></a>

Internal ID of the customer account that will own the payment method.   To create an orphan payment method that is not associated with any customer account, you do not need to specify this field during creation. However, you must associate the orphan payment method with a customer account within 10 days. Otherwise, this orphan payment method will be deleted. 

##### auth_gateway: `str`<a id="auth_gateway-str"></a>

Internal ID of the payment gateway that Zuora will use to authorize the payments that are made with the payment method.  If you do not set this field, Zuora will use one of the following payment gateways instead:  * The default payment gateway of the customer account that owns the payment method, if the `accountKey` field is set. * The default payment gateway of your Zuora tenant, if the `accountKey` field is not set.

##### credit_card_mask_number: `str`<a id="credit_card_mask_number-str"></a>

The masked credit card number, such as `*********1112`. This field is specific for the CC Reference Transaction payment method. It is an optional field that you can use to distinguish different CC Reference Transaction payment methods. Though there are no special restrictions on the input string, it is highly recommended to specify a card number that is masked. 

##### second_token_id: `str`<a id="second_token_id-str"></a>

A gateway unique identifier that replaces sensitive payment method data.   `secondTokenId` is conditionally required only when `tokenId` is being used to represent a gateway customer profile. `secondTokenId` is used in the CC Reference Transaction payment method.

This field is specific for setting up Google Pay on Chase gateway integrations to specify the stringified Google Pay token. For more information, see [Set up Google Pay on Chase](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/L_Payment_Methods/Payment_Method_Types/Set_up_Google_Pay_on_Chase). 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

The Merchant ID that was configured for use with Apple Pay in the Apple iOS Developer Center. 

##### payment_token: `Dict[str, Union[bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, None]]`<a id="payment_token-dictstr-unionbool-date-datetime-dict-float-int-list-str-none"></a>

The complete JSON Object representing the encrypted payment token payload returned in the response from the Apple Pay session.  

##### account_id: `str`<a id="account_id-str"></a>

The ID of the customer account associated with this payment method. To create an orphan payment method that is not associated with any customer account, you do not need to specify this field during creation. However, you must associate the orphan payment method with a customer account within 10 days. Otherwise, this orphan payment method will be deleted.

##### card_holder_info: [`CreatePaymentMethodCardholderInfo`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/create_payment_method_cardholder_info.py)<a id="card_holder_info-createpaymentmethodcardholderinfozuora_python_sdktypecreate_payment_method_cardholder_infopy"></a>


##### invoice_id: `str`<a id="invoice_id-str"></a>

The id of invoice this payment will apply to.  **Note:** When `processPayment` is `true`, this field is required. Only one invoice can be paid; for scenarios where you want to pay for multiple invoices, set `processPayment` to `false` and call payment API separately. 

##### mit_consent_agreement_src: `str`<a id="mit_consent_agreement_src-str"></a>

This field is only available for the following gateway integrations to create stored credential profiles within payment methods:   - Chase Paymentech Orbital Gateway   - CyberSource Payment API v2.0   - Stripe v2   - Vantiv (Now Worldpay)  Specify how the consent agreement has been established with the customer. The allowed value is `External`. It is required if the `mitProfileAction` field is specified. If you do not specify the `mitProfileAction` field, Zuora will automatically create a stored credential profile for the payment method, with the default value `External` set to this field. 

##### mit_profile_action: `str`<a id="mit_profile_action-str"></a>

This field is only available for the following gateway integrations to create stored credential profiles within payment methods:   - Chase Paymentech Orbital Gateway   - CyberSource Payment API v2.0   - Stripe v2   - Vantiv (Now Worldpay)  Specify either of the following values in this field:        - `Activate` - Use this value if you are creating the stored credential profile after receiving the customer's consent.          Zuora will create the stored credential profile then send a cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) to the payment gateway to validate the stored credential profile. If the CIT succeeds, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Active`. If the CIT does not succeed, Zuora will not create a stored credential profile.            If the payment gateway does not support the stored credential transaction framework, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Agreed`.        - `Persist` - Use this value if the stored credential profile represents a stored credential profile in an external system. The status of the payment method's stored credential profile will be `Active`.    If you do not specify this field, Zuora will automatically create a stored credential profile for the payment method, with the default value `Activate` set to this field.      

##### mit_profile_type: `str`<a id="mit_profile_type-str"></a>

This field is only available for the following gateway integrations to create stored credential profiles within payment methods:   - Chase Paymentech Orbital Gateway   - CyberSource Payment API v2.0   - Stripe v2   - Vantiv (Now Worldpay)  This field indicates the type of the stored credential profile to process recurring or unsecheduled transactions. It is required if the `mitProfileAction` field is specified. If you do not specify the `mitProfileAction` field, Zuora will automatically create a stored credential profile for the payment method, with the default value `Recurring` set to this field.      

##### payment_gateway: `str`<a id="payment_gateway-str"></a>

The label name of the gateway instance configured in Zuora that should process the payment. When creating a Payment, this must be a valid gateway instance ID and this gateway must support the specific payment method. If not specified, the default gateway of your Zuora customer account will be used.  **Note:** When `processPayment` is `true`, this field is required. When `processPayment` is `false`, the default payment gateway of your Zuora customer account will be used no matter whether a payment gateway instance is specified in the `paymentGateway` field. 

##### process_payment: `bool`<a id="process_payment-bool"></a>

A boolean flag to control whether a payment should be processed after creating payment method. The payment amount will be equivalent to the amount the merchant supplied in the ApplePay session. Default is false.  If this field is set to `true`, you must specify the `paymentGateway` field with the payment gateway instance name.  If this field is set to `false`:   - The default payment gateway of your Zuora customer account will be used no matter whether a payment gateway instance is specified in the `paymentGateway` field.    - You must select the **Verify new credit card** check box on the gateway instance settings page. Otherwise, the cryptogram will not be sent to the gateway.   - A separate subscribe or payment API call is required after this payment method creation call. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

### `zuora.payment_runs.payment_run`<a id="zuorapayment_runspayment_run"></a>

Creates a payment run. You can create a payment run to be executed immediately after it is created, or a scheduled payment run to be executed in future.

To filter the payments to be collected for a payment run, you can use either of the following methods but not both:

  - Use the `accountId`, `batch`, `billCycleDay`, `currency`, `paymentGatewayId`, and `billingRunId` fields to define the billing documents to be collected.
  - Use the `data` field to specify the records of accounts and billing documents to be collected, in a more flexible manner. See [Create custom payment runs through Zuora REST API](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/K_Payment_Operations/CA_Payment_Runs/Create_custom_payment_runs_through_Zuora_REST_API) for more information.

If no filter criteria are specified in the request body, the payment run collects payments for all accounts.

### `zuora.payment_schedules.payment_schedule`<a id="zuorapayment_schedulespayment_schedule"></a>

Creates a payment schedule. You can create either recurring payment schedules or custom payment schedules.

**Note:**
- This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled.
- You can choose to use payment schedules to process payments associated with billing documents or unapplied payments. If Standalone Payment is enabled, you can also use payment schedules to process standalone payments.
- This operation is version controlled. If you set `zuora-version` to `329.0`, when creating custom payment schedules associated with billing documents, you need to specify the billing document for each payment schedule item; If `zuora-version` is set to `330.0`, when creating custom payment schedules associated with billing documents, you only need to specify the billing documents at the payment schedule level. The default version number is `329.0`. However, we recommend that you specify the version to `330.0`. `329.0` will be deprecated soon.

### `zuora.payment_schedules.payment_schedule_1`<a id="zuorapayment_schedulespayment_schedule_1"></a>

Updates a payment schedule. For custom payment schedules, only the custom fields on the payment schedules can be udpated. Use the [Update a payment schedule item](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/PUT_PaymentScheduleItem/) operation to update payment schedule items of custom payment schedule.

Note the following rules for the `periodStartDate`, `period`, and `occurrences`:

- If `periodStartDate` is specified, all pending payment schedule items will be rescheduled using this new `periodStartDate`. If `period` is changed, we recommend passing in `periodStartDate`. Otherwise, the system would use the original start date if there is no processed or canceled items, or the last processed or canceled '`scheduleDate` + 1 `period`' as the new `periodStartDate`.
- If only `occurrences` is updated, the new item will start with the last processed or canceled '`scheduleDate` + 1 `period`'.

**Note:**
- The Payment Schedules feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payments_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center.
- This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled.

##### amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="amount-unionint-float"></a>

Indicates the updated amount of the pending payment schedule items. 

##### currency: `str`<a id="currency-str"></a>

Indicates the updated currency of the pending payment schedule items.       

##### occurrences: `int`<a id="occurrences-int"></a>

Indicates the updated number of payment schedule items that are created by the payment schedule.  **Note:**   - If \\\"updated `occurrences` > existing `occurrences`\\\", the following number of pending payment schedule item will be added to the payment schedule: “updated `occurrences` - existing `occurrences`”.   - If \\\"existing `occurrences` > updated `occurrences` >= the number of `processed`/`errored`/`canceled` payment schedule items\\\", the following number of pending items will be removed by descending order of the schedule dates: \\\"existing `occurrences` - updated `occurrences`\\\".   - If \\\"updated `occurrences` < the number of `processed`/`erroed`/`canceled` payment schedule items\\\", a validation error will be returned. 

##### payment_gateway_id: `str`<a id="payment_gateway_id-str"></a>

Indicates the updated payment gateway ID of the pending payment schedule items. 

##### payment_method_id: `str`<a id="payment_method_id-str"></a>

### `zuora.payment_schedules.payment_schedule_update_preview`<a id="zuorapayment_schedulespayment_schedule_update_preview"></a>

Preview the result of a payment schedule update. This operation only provides a preview. No changes will be made to the database. For custom payment schedules, only the custom fields on the payment schedules can be udpated. Use the [Update a payment schedule item](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/tag/PUT_PaymentScheduleItem) operation to update payment schedule items of custom payment schedule.

Note the following rules for the `periodStartDate`, `period`, and `occurrences`:

- If `periodStartDate` is specified, all pending payment schedule items will be rescheduled using this new `periodStartDate`. If `period` is changed, we recommend passing in `periodStartDate`. Otherwise, the system would use the original start date if there is no processed or canceled items, or the last processed or canceled '`scheduleDate` + 1 `period`' as the new `periodStartDate`.
- If only `occurrences` is updated, the new item will start with the last processed or canceled '`scheduleDate` + 1 `period`'.

**Note:**
- The Payment Schedules feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payments_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center.

    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_version="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### payment_schedule_key: `str`<a id="payment_schedule_key-str"></a>

The unique ID or number of a payment schedule. For example, `8a90857b822459cd018224dcb9eb13be`, or `PS-00000007`. 

##### amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="amount-unionint-float"></a>

Indicates the updated amount of the pending payment schedule items. 

##### currency: `str`<a id="currency-str"></a>

Indicates the updated currency of the pending payment schedule items.       

##### occurrences: `int`<a id="occurrences-int"></a>

Indicates the updated number of payment schedule items that are created by the payment schedule. 

##### payment_gateway_id: `str`<a id="payment_gateway_id-str"></a>

Indicates the updated payment gateway ID of the pending payment schedule items. 

##### payment_method_id: `str`<a id="payment_method_id-str"></a>

Indicates the updated payment method ID of the pending payment schedule items.  

##### payment_option: List[`PaymentSchedulePaymentOptionFields`]<a id="payment_option-listpaymentschedulepaymentoptionfields"></a>

Container for the paymentOption items, which describe the transactional level rules for processing payments. Currently, only the Gateway Options type is supported.  Here is an example: ``` \\\"paymentOption\\\": [   {     \\\"type\\\": \\\"GatewayOptions\\\",     \\\"detail\\\": {       \\\"SecCode\\\":\\\"WEB\\\"     }   } ] ```  `paymentOption` of the payment schedule takes precedence over `paymentOption` of the payment schedule item. 

##### period: `str`<a id="period-str"></a>

Indicates the updated period of the pending payment schedule items. 

##### period_start_date: `date`<a id="period_start_date-date"></a>

Indicates the updated collection date for the next pending payment schedule item. 

##### run_hour: `int`<a id="run_hour-int"></a>

Specifies at which hour of the day in the tenant’s time zone this payment will be collected. Available values: `[0,1,2,~,22,23]`.    If the time difference between your tenant’s timezone and the timezone where Zuora servers are is not in full hours, for example, 2.5 hours, the payment schedule items will be triggered half hour later than your scheduled time. If the payment `runHour` and `scheduledDate` are backdated, the system will collect the payment when the next runHour occurs. 

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_version: `str`<a id="zuora_version-str"></a>

The minor version of the Zuora REST API. See [Minor Version](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version) for information about REST API version control.   This header affects the availability of the following fields: - `items` > `paymentId`

### `zuora.payment_schedules.payment_schedules_0`<a id="zuorapayment_schedulespayment_schedules_0"></a>

Creates multiple payment schedules at once. You can create both recurring payment schedules and custom payment schedules in one request. The maximum number of payment schedules that can be created by a single request is 50. The maximum number of payment schedule items that each payment schedule can contain is 1000, i.e., you must specify less than 1000 items for a custom payment schedule, and the `occurrences` field must be less than 1000 for a recurring payment schedule.

**Note:**
- The Payment Schedules feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payments_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center.
- This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled.
- If Standalone Payment is enabled, you can choose to use payment schedules to process payments associated with billing documents, standalone payments, or unapplied payments. If Standalone Payment is not enabled, you can only use payment schedules to process unapplied payments or payments associated with billing documents.
- This operation is version controlled. If you set `zuora-version` to `329.0`, when creating custom payment schedules associated with billing documents, you need to specify the billing document for each payment schedule item; If `zuora-version` is set to `330.0`, when creating custom payment schedules associated with billing documents, you only need to specify the billing documents at the payment schedule level. The default version number is `329.0`. However, we recommend that you specify the version to `330.0`. `329.0` will be deprecated soon.

### `zuora.payment_transaction_logs.g_et_payment_transaction_log`<a id="zuorapayment_transaction_logsg_et_payment_transaction_log"></a>

Retrieves information about a specific payment transaction log.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
g_et_payment_transaction_log_response = zuora.payment_transaction_logs.g_et_payment_transaction_log(
    id="id_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### id: `str`<a id="id-str"></a>

The ID of a payment transaction log. 

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).

The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. 

Applies an unapplied payment to invoices and debit memos.

When you apply a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo items that the payment will apply to must be less than or equal to 15,000.
        
If the limit is hit, you can follow the instructions:
- If you want to apply one payment to multiple invoices or debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request.
- If you want to apply one payment to a single invoice or debit memo with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.

For more information, see [Apply Unapplied Payments to Invoices and Debit Memos](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/Apply_Unapplied_Payments_to_Invoices_and_Debit_Memos).

### `zuora.payments.create_payment`<a id="zuorapaymentscreate_payment"></a>

**Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

Creates a payment in the following scenarios:

- A full or partial payment on an invoice or a debit memo
- A full or partial payment on several invoices and debit memos
- An unapplied payment in the following situations:
  - You do not know which customer account the payment belongs to.
  - You know which customer account the payment belongs to, but you do not know which invoice the payment is applied to.
  - You receive a payment from your customer that exceeds the balance on the invoice.
  - You receive a payment from your customer before the invoice has been created.
  - You intend to create a payment without any invoices or debit memos.
- A standalone payment. If you only need to create and process an electronic payment in Zuora through a Zuora gateway integration but settle the payment outside of Zuora, you can create a standalone payment. For a standalone payment, you can specify a currency different from the payment currency in the customer account settings. When Standalone Payment is not enabled, the currency of the standalone payment can be different from the payment currency defined in the customer account settings if you have the [Multiple Currencies](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Bill_your_customers/Flexible_Billing/Multiple_Currencies) feature enabled. 

  The support for standalone payments is in the Early Adopter phase. To manage and access this feature through the self-service interface, see [Manage Features](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payments_Settings/Manage_Features) in the Knowledge Center.


If you do not know to which customer account the payment belongs, you can create a payment without specifying a customer account.

When you create a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo items that the payment will apply to should be less than or equal to 15,000.

For more information, see [Create Payments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/AA_Create_Payments) and [Create Payments Without Specifying Customer Accounts](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/AA_Create_Payments_Without_Specifying_Customer_Accounts).

##### account_number: `str`<a id="account_number-str"></a>

The number of the customer account that the payment is created for, such as `A00000001`.  You can specify either `accountNumber` or `accountId` for a customer account. If both of them are specified, they must refer to the same customer account. 

##### amount: `Union[int, float]`<a id="amount-unionint-float"></a>

The total amount of the payment. 

##### auth_transaction_id: `str`<a id="auth_transaction_id-str"></a>

The authorization transaction ID from the payment gateway. Use this field for electronic payments, such as credit cards.  When you create a payment for capturing the authorized funds, it is highly recommended to pass in the gatewayOrderId that you used when authorizing the funds by using the [Create authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateAuthorization) operation, together with the `authTransactionId` field.  The following payment gateways support this field:   - Adyen Integration v2.0   - CyberSource 1.28   - CyberSource 1.97   - CyberSource 2.0   - Chase Paymentech Orbital   - Ingenico ePayments   - SlimPay   - Stripe v2   - Verifi Global Payment Gateway   - WePay Payment Gateway Integration 

##### comment: `str`<a id="comment-str"></a>

Additional information related to the payment. 

##### currency: `str`<a id="currency-str"></a>

When Standalone Payment is not enabled, the `currency` of the payment must be the same as the payment currency defined in the customer account settings through Zuora UI. But if you have the [Multiple Currencies](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Bill_your_customers/Flexible_Billing/Multiple_Currencies) feature enabled, you can have a different payment currency.  When Standalone Payment is enabled and `standalone` is `true`, the `currency` of the standalone payment can be different from the payment currency defined in the customer account settings. The amount will not be summed up to the account balance or key metrics regardless of currency. 

##### custom_rates: List[`PaymentWithCustomRatesType`]<a id="custom_rates-listpaymentwithcustomratestype"></a>

It contains Home currency and Reporting currency custom rates currencies. The maximum number of items is 2 (you can pass the Home currency item or Reporting currency item or both).  **Note**: The API custom rate feature is permission controlled. 

##### debit_memos: List[`PaymentDebitMemoApplicationCreateRequestType`]<a id="debit_memos-listpaymentdebitmemoapplicationcreaterequesttype"></a>

Container for debit memos. The maximum number of debit memos is 1,000. 

##### effective_date: `date`<a id="effective_date-date"></a>

The date when the payment takes effect, in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.  **Note:**   - This field is required for only electronic payments. It's an optional field for external payments.   - When specified, this field must be set to the date of today.   - When applying or transferring payments, this field must be later than or equal to the maximum effective date of the payment. 

##### finance_information: [`Dict[str, Union[bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, None]]`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/typing_dict_str_typing_union_bool_date_datetime_dict_float_int_list_str_none.py)<a id="finance_information-dictstr-unionbool-date-datetime-dict-float-int-list-str-nonezuora_python_sdktypetyping_dict_str_typing_union_bool_date_datetime_dict_float_int_list_str_nonepy"></a>


Container for the finance information related to the payment. 

##### gateway_id: `str`<a id="gateway_id-str"></a>

The ID of the gateway instance that processes the payment. The ID must be a valid gateway instance ID and this gateway must support the specific payment method.  - If <a href=\\\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payment_gateway_integrations/Payment_Gateway_Routing\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Payment Gateway Routing</a> is enabled, when creating electronic payments, this field is optional.      - If this field is not specified, gateway routing rules will be invoked.     - If this field is specified, the specified gateway will be used to process the payment.  - If Payment Gateway Routing is disabled, when creating electronic payments, this field is required.  - When creating external payments, this field is optional.  Use the same gateway instance if both `paymentGatewayNumber` and `gatewayId` are sent in the request. 

##### gateway_options: [`Dict[str, Union[bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, None]]`](./zuora_python_sdk/type/typing_dict_str_typing_union_bool_date_datetime_dict_float_int_list_str_none.py)<a id="gateway_options-dictstr-unionbool-date-datetime-dict-float-int-list-str-nonezuora_python_sdktypetyping_dict_str_typing_union_bool_date_datetime_dict_float_int_list_str_nonepy"></a>


The field used to pass gateway-specific parameters and parameter values. The fields supported by gateways vary. For more information, see the Overview topic of each gateway integration in [Zuora Knowledge Center](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Billing_and_Payments/M_Payment_Gateways/Supported_Payment_Gateways).  Zuora sends all the information that you specified to the gateway. If you specify any unsupported gateway option parameters, they will be ignored without error prompts. 

##### gateway_order_id: `str`<a id="gateway_order_id-str"></a>

A merchant-specified natural key value that can be passed to the electronic payment gateway when a payment is created. If not specified, the payment number will be passed in instead.  Gateways check duplicates on the gateway order ID to ensure that the merchant do not accidentally enter the same transaction twice. This ID can also be used to do reconciliation and tie the payment to a natural key in external systems. The source of this ID varies by merchant. Some merchants use their shopping cart order IDs, and others use something different. Merchants use this ID to track transactions in their eCommerce systems.  When you create a payment for capturing the authorized funds, it is highly recommended to pass in the gatewayOrderId that you used when authorizing the funds by using the [Create authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateAuthorization) operation, together with the `authTransactionId` field. 

##### invoices: List[`PaymentInvoiceApplicationCreateRequestType`]<a id="invoices-listpaymentinvoiceapplicationcreaterequesttype"></a>

Container for invoices. The maximum number of invoices is 1,000. 

##### mit_transaction_source: `str`<a id="mit_transaction_source-str"></a>

Payment transaction source used to differentiate the transaction source in Stored Credential Transaction framework.   - `C_Unscheduled`: Cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) that does not occur on scheduled or regularly occurring dates.   - `M_Recurring`: Merchant-initiated transaction (MIT) that occurs at regular intervals.   - `M_Unscheduled`: Merchant-initiated transaction (MIT) that does not occur on scheduled or regularly occurring dates.   - `M_MOTO`: Mail Order Telephone Order (MOTO) payment transaction. This option is only available for credit card payments on Stripe v2. See [Overview of Stripe payment gateway integration](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Collect/Payment_gateway_integrations/Supported_payment_gateways/Stripe_Payment_Gateway/A_Overview_of_Stripe_payment_gateway_integration) for more information. 

##### payment_gateway_number: `str`<a id="payment_gateway_number-str"></a>

The natural key for the payment gateway.   Use the same gateway instance if both `paymentGatewayNumber` and `gatewayId` are sent in the request. 

##### payment_method_id: `str`<a id="payment_method_id-str"></a>

The unique ID of the payment method that the customer used to make the payment.   If no payment method ID is specified in the request body, the default payment method for the customer account is used automatically. If the default payment method is different from the type of payments that you want to create, an error occurs. 

##### payment_method_type: `str`<a id="payment_method_type-str"></a>

The type of the payment method that the customer used to make the payment.   Specify this value when you are creating an external payment method. If both `paymentMethodType` and `paymentMethodId` are specified, only the `paymentMethodId` value is used to create the payment. 

##### payment_option: List[`PaymentSchedulePaymentOptionFields`]<a id="payment_option-listpaymentschedulepaymentoptionfields"></a>

Container for the paymentOption items, which describe the transactional level rules for processing payments. Currently, only the Gateway Options type is supported.  Here is an example: ``` \\\"paymentOption\\\": [   {     \\\"type\\\": \\\"GatewayOptions\\\",     \\\"detail\\\": {       \\\"SecCode\\\":\\\"WEB\\\"     }   } ] ```  `paymentOption` of the payment schedule takes precedence over `paymentOption` of the payment schedule item.  You can use this field or the `gatewayOptions` field to pass the Gateway Options fields supported by a payment gateway. However, the Gateway Options fields passed through the `paymentOption` field will be stored in the Payment Option object and can be easily retrieved. 

##### payment_schedule_key: `str`<a id="payment_schedule_key-str"></a>

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

##### page: `int`<a id="page-int"></a>

The index number of the page that you want to retrieve. This parameter is dependent on `pageSize`. You must set `pageSize` before specifying `page`. For example, if you set `pageSize` to `20` and `page` to `2`, the 21st to 40th records are returned in the response.

For example:  *operator* *field_name*, *operator* *field_name*    *operator* is used to mark the order of sequencing. The operator is optional. If you only specify the sortable field without any operator, the response data is sorted in descending order by this field.    - The `-` operator indicates an ascending order.   - The `+` operator indicates a descending order.  By default, the response data is displayed in descending order by payment number.  *field_name* indicates the name of a sortable field.

### `zuora.prepaid_with_drawdown.deplete_funds`<a id="zuoraprepaid_with_drawdowndeplete_funds"></a>

Depleting a prepaid balance fund enables you to expire the remaining balance, which can be recognized by revenue. When an expiry request is received, the remaining fund balance is reduced to zero, and the related objects like PrepaidBalance, ValidityPeriodSummary, PrepaidBalanceTransaction, and DailyConsumption will be updated. 

#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
deplete_funds_response = zuora.prepaid_with_drawdown.deplete_funds(
    body=None,
    fund_ids={},
    idempotency_key="string_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### product_rate_plan_charge_id: `str`<a id="product_rate_plan_charge_id-str"></a>

The unique ID of the product rate plan charge to be used in the product rate plan. 

##### product_rate_plan_charge_number: `str`<a id="product_rate_plan_charge_number-str"></a>

The unique number (natural key) of the product rate plan charge to be used in the product rate plan. 

##### product_rate_plan_id: `str`<a id="product_rate_plan_id-str"></a>

The unique ID of the product rate plan that uses this rate plan definition. 

##### product_rate_plan_number: `str`<a id="product_rate_plan_number-str"></a>

The unique number (natural key) of the product rate plan that uses this rate plan definition. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### reject_unknown_fields: `bool`<a id="reject_unknown_fields-bool"></a>

Specifies whether the call fails if the request body contains unknown fields. With `rejectUnknownFields` set to `true`, Zuora returns a 400 response if the request body contains unknown fields. The body of the 400 response is:  ```json {     \"message\": \"Error - unrecognised fields\" } ```  By default, Zuora ignores unknown fields in the request body. 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).

##### active_currencies: List[`str`]<a id="active_currencies-liststr"></a>

A list of 3-letter currency codes representing active currencies for the product rate plan. Use a comma to separate each currency code.  If the request body contains this field, the value of this field must contain the desired list of active currencies. The new list can never have more than four differences from the existing list.  This field cannot be used to modify the status of more than four currencies in a single request. For example, in a single request, you can only activate four currencies, or deactivate four currencies, or activate two and deactivate two. Making more than four changes to currencies always requires more than one call.  When specifying this field in the update request, you must provide the full list of active currencies you want, not just incremental changes. For each active currency update, provide the following currencies in the list:  Current active currencies + at most four changes (additions or deletions)

    id="id_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### id: `str`<a id="id-str"></a>

Object id

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`).

### `zuora.rsa_signatures.decrypt_rsa_signatures`<a id="zuorarsa_signaturesdecrypt_rsa_signatures"></a>

The REST API used in Payment Pages 2.0 are CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) enabled and therefore requires a digital signature. You use rsa_signatures to generate the required digital signature and token for a Payment Pages 2.0 form, and then you use the decrypt REST service to decrypt the signature to validate the signature and key.

This REST service should be used only when you implement Payment Pages 2.0.

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.rsa_signatures.r_sa_signatures`<a id="zuorarsa_signaturesr_sa_signatures"></a>

The REST API used in Payment Pages 2.0 are CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) enabled and therefore requires a digital signature. The POST rsa_signatures call generates and returns the required digital signature and token for a Payment Pages 2.0 form. You need to pass the generated signature to your client for it to access Payment Pages 2.0. 
    
This REST service should be used only when you implement Payment Pages 2.0. 

**Note:** To avoid potential credit card fraud attacks, you should secure your Payment Pages from being accessed by fraudulent users before you issue client-side digital signatures and tokens. See [Manage Token Issuance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/LA_Hosted_Payment_Pages/B_Payment_Pages_2.0/F_Generate_the_Digital_Signature_for_Payment_Pages_2.0#Manage_Token_Issuance) for more information.

**Troubleshooting tip:** After you use this operation to generate an RSA signature, if `signature` returns `null` but `token` is successfully returned, please limit the number of the fields in your request to make sure that the maximum length supported by the RSA signature algorithm is not exceeded. The calculation of the request length is determined by the number of the parameters, and the length of each of the parameter name and its value.

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

### `zuora.regenerate.regenerate_billing_transaction`<a id="zuoraregenerateregenerate_billing_transaction"></a>

Use this operation to generate billing transactions. This call is useful in the following two use cases: 
* During customer onboarding, there is a common scenario when customers perform data backfill or data fixes. To synchronize these changes from Billing to Revenue, use this API operation to regenerate billing transaction objects.
* Customers choose to experiment with their use cases in the Sandbox environment before implementing them in the Production environment. During this experimentation phase, customers not only interact with data but also use this API operation to regenerate transaction objects.


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
regenerate_billing_transaction_response = zuora.regenerate.regenerate_billing_transaction(
    authorization="Authorization_example",
    document_id="string_example",
    number="CM00000001",
    type="CreditMemo",
    idempotency_key="string_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    only_re_send=True,
    re_migrate=True,
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### document_id: `str`<a id="document_id-str"></a>

Id of Invoice, CreditMemo, DebitMemo, or InvoiceItemAdjustment 

##### number: `str`<a id="number-str"></a>

Number of Invoice, CreditMemo, DebitMemo, or InvoiceItemAdjustment 

##### type: `str`<a id="type-str"></a>

The type of business object for which you want to generate the transactions. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### only_re_send: `bool`<a id="only_re_send-bool"></a>

If `onlyReSend` is true, existing booking transactions in the database will not be overridden and sent into Revenue for re-collecting, i.e. regenerate_flag is Y.  If `onlyReSend` is false, Whether existing booking transactions in the database will be overridden and sent into Revenue for re-collecting depends on the value of `reMigrate`.  **Note:** If `onlyReSend` is true, the `reMigrate` can't be true. 

##### re_migrate: `bool`<a id="re_migrate-bool"></a>

If `reMigrate` is true, existing booking transactions in the database will be overridden and sent into Revenue for re-collecting, i.e. regenerate_flag is Y.  If `reMigrate` is false, existing booking transactions in the database will not be overridden and sent into Revenue with regenerate_flag as N.  **Note:** If `onlyReSend` is true, the `reMigrate` can't be true.

You can use query parameters to restrict the data returned in the response.

**Note**: The Credit and Debit Memos feature is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. 


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
sequence_sets_response = zuora.sequence_sets.sequence_sets(
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    page_size=20,
    page=1,
    name="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### page_size: `int`<a id="page_size-int"></a>

The number of records returned per page in the response. 

##### page: `int`<a id="page-int"></a>

The index number of the page that you want to retrieve. This parameter is dependent on `pageSize`. You must set `pageSize` before specifying `page`. For example, if you set `pageSize` to `20` and `page` to `2`, the 21st to 40th records are returned in the response. 

##### name: `str`<a id="name-str"></a>

The name of a specific sequence set. 

#### 🔄 Return<a id="🔄-return"></a>

[`GETSequenceSetsResponse`](./zuora_python_sdk/pydantic/get_sequence_sets_response.py)

### `zuora.sequence_sets.sequence_sets_0`<a id="zuorasequence_setssequence_sets_0"></a>

Creates sequence sets, allowing distinct numbering sequences for billing documents, payments, and refunds. Billing documents include invoices, credit memos, and debit memos.

You can create a maximum of 100 sequence sets in one single request. A sequence set comprises a set of custom prefixes and starting numbers that are used for billing documents to generate, and payments and refunds to create.

See [Prefix and Numbering Configuration for Billing Documents](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Billing_Settings/Prefix_and_Numbering_Configuration_for_Billing_Documents) for more information about limitations.

**Note**: The Credit and Debit Memos feature is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

### `zuora.sign_up.sign_up`<a id="zuorasign_upsign_up"></a>

This call performs many actions. You can use this operation to implement the standard requirements for signing up a customer, such as validating the uniqueness of an account and limiting the number of subscriptions per account. Also, you can use this operation to create a subscription, generate an invoice, and collect payment for a new or existing customer. 

**Note:** You need to have the [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Subscriptions/Orders) or [Orders Harmonization](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Orders_Harmonization) feature enabled to use this API.

For a new customer, you can perform the following tasks in one call. Note that you can skip creating a payment meethod and still get the subscription and invoice successfully created.
* Create an account
* Create a payment method
* Subscribe to a product in the product catalog and create a subscription
* Generate an invoice
* Collect payment

For an existing customer, you can use an account identification field of an external system to specify the account.

You can make [make asynchronous requests](https://developer.zuora.com/rest-api/general-concepts/async-requests/) when using the "Sign up" operation.

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

To use this field in the method, you must set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header. 

##### term_start_date: `date`<a id="term_start_date-date"></a>

The date on which the subscription term begins, as yyyy-mm-dd. If this is a renewal subscription, this date is different from the subscription start date. 

##### term_type: `str`<a id="term_type-str"></a>

Possible values are: `TERMED`, `EVERGREEN`. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 

##### zuora_version: `str`<a id="zuora_version-str"></a>

 The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   You need to set this parameter if you use the following fields: * targetDate * includeExistingDraftDocItems * previewType * taxationItems   If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, you need to specify this parameter.

### `zuora.subscriptions.subscription`<a id="zuorasubscriptionssubscription"></a>

This REST API reference describes how to create a new subscription for an existing customer account.

### Notes<a id="notes"></a>

If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, it is best practice to set the `zuora-version` parameter to `211.0` or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). Otherwise, an error occurs.

If `invoiceCollect` is `true`, the call will not return `success` = `true` unless the subscription, invoice, and payment are all successful.

Default values for **customerAcceptanceDate** and **serviceActivationDate** are set as follows. This API operation does not support creating a pending subscription.

|        | serviceActivationDate(SA) specified          | serviceActivationDate (SA) NOT specified  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| customerAcceptanceDate (CA) specified| SA uses value in the request call; CA uses value in the request call| CA uses value in the request call;SA uses CE as default |
| customerAcceptanceDate (CA) NOT specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses SA as default |   SA and CA use CE as default |

### `zuora.subscriptions.subscription_0`<a id="zuorasubscriptionssubscription_0"></a>

Use this call to make the following kinds of changes to a subscription:
  * Add a note
  * Change the renewal term or auto-renewal flag
  * Change the term length or change between evergreen and termed
  * Add a new product rate plan
  * Remove an existing subscription rate plan
  * Change the quantity or price of an existing subscription rate plan
  * Change rate plans - to replace the existing rate plans in a subscription with other rate plans. Changing rate plans is currently not supported for Billing - Revenue Integration. When Billing - Revenue Integration is enabled, changing rate plans will no longer be applicable in Zuora Billing.

### Notes<a id="notes"></a>
* The "Update a subscription" call creates a new subscription object that has a new version number and to which the subscription changes are applied. The new subscription object has the same subscription name but a new, different, subscription ID. The `Status` field of the new subscription object will be set to `Active` unless the change applied was a cancelation or suspension in which case the status reflects that. The `Status` field of the originating subscription object changes from `Active` to `Expired`. A status of `Expired` does not imply that the subscription itself has expired or ended, merely that this subscription object is no longer the most recent.
* In one request, this call can make:
  * Up to 9 combined add, update, and remove changes
  * No more than 1 change to terms & conditions
* Updates are performed in the following sequence:
  1. First change the notes on the existing subscription, if requested.
  2. Then change the terms and conditions, if requested.
  3. Then perform the remaining amendments based upon the effective dates specified. If multiple amendments have the same contract-effective dates, then execute adds before updates, and updates before removes.
* The update operation is atomic. If any of the updates fails, the entire operation is rolled back.
* The response of the Update Subscription call is based on the REST API minor version you set in the request header. The response structure might be different if you use different minor version numbers. 
* If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, it is best practice to set the `zuora-version` parameter to `211.0` or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). Otherwise, an error occurs.

### Override a Tiered Price<a id="override-a-tiered-price"></a>
There are two ways you override a tiered price:

* Override a specific tier number
For example: `tiers[{tier:1,price:8},{tier:2,price:6}]`

* Override the entire tier structure
For example:  `tiers[{tier:1,price:8,startingUnit:1,endingUnit:100,priceFormat:"FlatFee"},
{tier:2,price:6,startingUnit:101,priceFormat:"FlatFee"}]`

If you just override a specific tier, do not include the `startingUnit` field in the request.

Possible values are:  * __last-segment__: (Default) The last rate plan charge on the subscription. The last rate plan charge is the last one in the order of time on the subscription rather than the most recent changed charge on the subscription.  * __current-segment__: The segmented charge that is active on today’s date (effectiveStartDate <= today’s date < effectiveEndDate).    * __all-segments__: All the segmented charges. The `chargeSegments` field is returned in the response. The `chargeSegments` field contains an array of the charge information for all the charge segments.   * __specific-segment&as-of-date=date__: The segmented charge that is active on a date you specified (effectiveStartDate <= specific date < effectiveEndDate). The format of the date is yyyy-mm-dd.

You must have the "Cancel Journal Entry" user permission enabled to cancel summary journal entries.
    
A summary journal entry cannot be canceled if its Transferred to Accounting status is "Yes" or "Processing".


#### 🛠️ Usage<a id="🛠️-usage"></a>

```python
summary_journal_entry_2_response = zuora.summary_journal_entries.summary_journal_entry_2(
    je_number="je-number_example",
    accept_encoding="string_example",
    content_encoding="string_example",
    authorization="string_example",
    zuora_track_id="string_example",
    zuora_entity_ids="string_example",
    zuora_org_ids="string_example",
)
```

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### je_number: `str`<a id="je_number-str"></a>

Journal entry number in the format JE-00000001.

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### `zuora.usage.usage`<a id="zuorausageusage"></a>

This REST API reference describes how to post or import usage data for one or more accounts in the CSV format. There are no path or query parameters. The data is uploaded using the HTTP multipart/form-data POST method and applied to the user's tenant. 

### How this REST API Call Works<a id="how-this-rest-api-call-works"></a>
The content of the uploaded usage file must follow the format used by the UI import tool. It must be a comma-separated (CSV) file with a corresponding .csv extension. The length of the file name must not exceed 50 characters. The file size must not exceed 4MB. See [Downloading the Usage Template](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/J_Billing_Operations/Usage/C_Import_Usage_Data#Downloading_the_Usage_Template) to learn about how to download the usage file template.

At the completion of the upload, before the file contents are actually being processed, the API returns a response containing the byte count of the received file and a URL for checking the status of the import process.  Of the five possible results displayed at that URL (Pending, Processing, Completed, Canceled, and Failed) only a Completed status indicates that the import was successful.  The operation is atomic; if any record fails, the file is rejected. In that case, the entire import is rolled back and all stored data is returned to its original state.

To view the actual import status, enter the resulting status URL from the checkImportStatus response using a tool such as POSTMAN. This additional step provides more information about why the import has failed.

To manage the information after a successful upload, use the web-based UI.

### Usage File Format<a id="usage-file-format"></a>
The usage file uses the following headings: 

| Heading         | Description   | Required |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| ACCOUNT_ID      | Enter the account number, e.g., the default account number, such as A00000001, or your custom account number. Although this field is labeled as Account_Id, it is not the actual Account ID nor Account Name.  | Yes      |
| UOM             | Enter the unit of measure. This must match the UOM for the usage. | Yes      |
| QTY             | Enter the quantity.  | Yes      |
| STARTDATE       | Enter the start date of the usage. This date determines the invoice item service period the associated usage is billed to. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`. | Yes |
| ENDDATE         | Enter the end date of the usage. This is not used in calculations for usage billing and is optional. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`. <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p> | No |
| SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Enter the subscription number or subscription name. If you created the subscription in the Zuora application, Zuora created a number automatically in a format similar to A-S00000001. If you do not provide a value for this field, the associated usage will be added to all subscriptions for the specified Account that use this Unit Of Measure. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record.  <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p>  | No   |
| CHARGE_ID       | Enter the charge number (not the charge name). You can see the charge ID, e.g., C-00000001, when you add your rate plan to your subscription and view your individual charges. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the specific Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. This field is related to the Charge Number on the subscription rate plan.  <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p>  | No      |
| DESCRIPTION     | Enter a description for the charge. | No       |
| UNIQUE_KEY      | Enter a specific identifier for this usage record. **Note**: This Heading is supported by the following <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Billing_and_Invoicing/JA_Advanced_Consumption_Billing">Advanced Consumption Billing</a> features: <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Billing_and_Invoicing/JA_Advanced_Consumption_Billing/Prepaid_with_Drawdown">Prepaid with Drawdown</a>, and <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Billing_and_Invoicing/JA_Advanced_Consumption_Billing/Unbilled_Usage">Unbilled Usage</a>.

#### ⚙️ Parameters<a id="⚙️-parameters"></a>

##### file: `IO`<a id="file-io"></a>

The usage data to import. The supported formats are excel, csv, and zip. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### zuora_track_id: `str`<a id="zuora_track_id-str"></a>

A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 

##### zuora_entity_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_entity_ids-str"></a>

An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 

##### zuora_org_ids: `str`<a id="zuora_org_ids-str"></a>

Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

##### authorization: `str`<a id="authorization-str"></a>

The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 

##### task_id: `str`<a id="task_id-str"></a>

The unique ID of the task. 

##### idempotency_key: `str`<a id="idempotency_key-str"></a>

Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.  

##### accept_encoding: `str`<a id="accept_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 

##### content_encoding: `str`<a id="content_encoding-str"></a>

Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.
